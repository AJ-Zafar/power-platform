# Available GitHub Adminstrative Actions for Microsoft Power Platform (Preview)

[This topic is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

Available GitHub Actions for administrative functions for Microsoft Power Platform are described in the following sections. 

## Configure deployment credentials

Many of the actions require you to connect to a Microsoft Dataverse environment. You can add service principal or user credentials as secrets in your the GitHub repository and then use them in the workflow.<br/>
For details on how to setup secrets in GitHub please refer to [the following article on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#using-encrypted-secrets-in-a-workflow) <br/>
To learn how to setup service principal authentication for Power Platform please refer to [following document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/alm/devops-build-tools#configure-service-connections-using-a-service-principal)<br/>

Once configured properly you can call the Service Principal from with in your Action scripts <br/>
Parameters to define within your GitHub Action Script as [Environment Variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/environment-variables): <br/>
Application Id such as: `WF_APPLICATION_ID:<your application id>` <br/>
Tenant Id such as: `WF_TENANT_ID:<your tenant id>` <br/>

The Client Secret will be stored as a GitHub Secret, as described earlier and will be referenced from within the action script using a parameter like: <br/>
`client secret: ${{secrets.CLIENT_SECRET_GITHUB_ACTIONS}}` <br/>
