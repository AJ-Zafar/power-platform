# ALM for admins and makers

This section describes how you as a Power Platform administrator or app maker can use available features, tools, and other resources to implement application lifecycle management (ALM) using Microsoft Power Platform.

## Power Platform pipelines

With Power Platform pipelines, admins create and configure pipelines so makers can use them to deploy solutions to environments with a single click. More information: [Overview of Power Platform pipelines (preview)](pipelines.md)

## Manage solutions using PowerShell

PowerShell cmdlets let admins automate many of the monitoring, management, and quality assurance tasks in Power Platform. More information: [Manage solutions using PowerShell](powershell-api.md)
