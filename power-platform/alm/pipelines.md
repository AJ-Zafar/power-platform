# Overview of Power Platform pipelines (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The most common form of ALM in Power Platform today involves either manual solution export and import or using pro-developer tools, such as Azure DevOps and GitHub. It's an either/or decision where things don't easily work together making it difficult to transition from manual to automated deployments.

With Power Platform pipelines, makers can easily use pre-configured pipelines to perform in-product deployments, and pro-code developers can manage CI/CD of apps, flows and bots with the tools of their choice. Pipelines can integrate with the existing pro dev tool set for CI/CD (including Azure DevOps and GitHub), and be managed as part of the organizationâ€™s existing DevOps processes.
