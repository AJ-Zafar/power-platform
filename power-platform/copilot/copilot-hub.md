# Copilot page

The Copilot page [preview] is a centralized location in the Power Platform Admin Center for documents, insights, and controls relevant to Power Platform Copilots. Tenant admins can access educational resources about Copilot features, track usage, and access governance controls in one place by clicking on the Copilot tab on the left nav: 

## Readiness 

Resources and documents to help admins better understand and govern Copilots are available in this section. These are living documents that will update over time as new Copilot capabilities are released. The “What’s New” section will show new Copilot features as they are introduced or promoted to GA. 

> [!Note]
> There may be a 1-2 week delay to updates made in the “What’s New” section. The Release Planner and Power Platform blogs are the best source to stay on top of new Copilot features. 

## Usage 

The usage metrics in this section show monthly active users for each Copilot feature. “Active” usage is defined as a session and/or interaction with Copilot.
