# What is Microsoft Power Platform SAP Supplier Self Service template?

The SAP Supplier Self Service template introduces a customizable Power Pages site to complement the [SAP Procurement](sap-procurement/overview) template. It leverages the same architecture as the SAP Procurement template utilizing Power Automate cloud flows and the SAP ERP connector for integration.

The SAP Supplier Self Service solution improves your procurement operations. It offers:

- A streamlined self-service site for your suppliers and vendors to create and update business records related to to Vendors, Orders, and Invoices.
- The ability for your team to approve the records before the data is entered into your SAP system.
- The option to set up a copilot chat bot to assist users.

The template's components are ready for you to extend and customize to meet your organization's unique needs. The template consists of two solutions:

- Supplier Self Service
- Supplier Self Service Portal
