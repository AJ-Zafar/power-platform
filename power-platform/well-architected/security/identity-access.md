# Recommendations for identity and access management

**Applies to this Power Well-Architected Security checklist recommendation:**

|[SE:05](checklist.md)|Implement strict, conditional, and auditable identity and access management (IAM) across all workload users, team members, and system components. Limit access exclusively to *as necessary*. Use modern industry standards for all authentication and authorization implementations. Restrict and rigorously audit access that's not based on identity.|
|---|---|

This guide describes the recommendations for authenticating and authorizing identities that are attempting to access your workload resources.

From a technical control perspective, **identity is always the primary perimeter**. This scope doesn't just include the edges of your workload. It also includes individual components that are inside your workload. Typical identities include:

**Humans**. Application users, admins, operators, auditors, and bad actors.

**Systems**. Workload identities, managed identities, API keys, service principals, and Azure resources.

**Anonymous**. Entities who haven't provided any evidence about who they are.

**Definitions** 

| Terms | Definition |
|---|---|
| Authentication (AuthN) | A process that verifies that an identity is who or what it says it is. |
| Authorization (AuthZ) | A process that verifies whether an identity has permission to perform a requested action. |
| Conditional access | A set of rules that allows actions based on specified criteria. |
| IdP | An identity provider, like Microsoft Entra ID. |
| Persona | A job function or a title that has a set of responsibilities and actions. |
| Preshared keys | A type of secret that's shared between a provider and consumer and used through a secure and agreed upon mechanism. |
| Resource identity | An identity defined for cloud resources that's managed by the platform. |
| Role | A set of permissions that define what a user or group can do. |
| Scope | Different levels of organizational hierarchy where a role is permitted to operate. Also a group of features in a system. |
| Security principal | An identity that provides permissions. It can be a user, a group, or a service principal. Any group members get the same level of access. |
| User identity | An identity for a person, like an employee or an external user. |
| Workload identity | A system identity for an application, service, script, container, or other component of a workload that's used to authenticate itself to other services and resources. |

> [!Note]
> An identity can be grouped with other, similar identities under a parent called a _security principal_. A security group is an example of a security principal. This hierarchical relationship simplifies maintenance and improves consistency. Because identity attributes aren't handled at the individual level, chances of errors are also reduced. In this article, the term _identity_ is inclusive of security principals.

### Microsoft Entra ID is the identity provider for Power Platform

All Power Platform products use Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory or Azure AD) for identity and access management. Entra ID enables organizations to secure and manage identity for their hybrid and multi-cloud environments. Entra ID is also essential for managing business guests needing access to Power Platform resources. Power Platform also uses Entra ID to manage other applications that need to integrate with Power Platform APIs using the service principal capabilities. By using Entra ID, the Power Platform can leverage Entra ID more advanced security features like Conditional Access and continuous access evaluation.

#### Authentication

Authentication is a process that verifies identities. The requesting identity is required to provide some form of verifiable identification. For example:

- A user name and password.
- A preshared secret, like an API key that grants access.
- A shared access signature (SAS) token.
- A certificate that's used in TLS mutual authentication.

Power Platform authentication involves a sequence of requests, responses, and redirects between the user's browser and Power Platform or Azure services. The sequence follows the [Microsoft Entra ID auth code grant flow](https://learn.microsoft.com//azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow). 

Connecting and authenticating to a data source is done separately from authenticating to a Power Platform service. Learn more: [Connecting and authenticating to data sources - Power Platform | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com//power-platform/admin/security/connect-data-sources)

#### Authorization

Power Platform uses Azure Active Directory's (Azure AD) [Microsoft Identity Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com//azure/active-directory/develop/v2-overview) for authorization of all API calls with the industry-standard OAuth 2.0 protocol.

## Key design strategies

To understand the identity needs for a workload, you need to list the flows, workload assets, and personas, and the actions they will do. Your strategy must cover all scenarios that involve the flows that go to the workload or its parts (outside-in access) and flows that go from the workload to other sources (inside-out access).

Each use case will probably have its own set of controls that you need to design with an assume-breach mindset. Based on the identity requirements of the use case or the personas, identify the conditional choices. Avoid using one solution for all use cases. Conversely, the controls shouldn't be so granular that you introduce unnecessary management overhead.

You need to log the identity access trail. Doing so helps validate the controls, and you can use the logs for compliance audits.

### Determine all identities for authentication

**Outside-in access**. Power Platform authentication involves a sequence of requests, responses, and redirects between the user's browser and Power Platform or Azure services. The sequence follows the [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) auth code grant flow](https://learn.microsoft.com//azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow). Power Platform automatically authenticates all users that access the workload for various purposes. 

**Inside-out access**. Your workload will need to access other resources. For example, reading from or writing to the data platform, retrieving secrets from the secret store, and logging telemetry to monitoring services. It might even need to access third-party services. These access needs require **workload identity**, which enables the application to authenticate itself against the other resources.

The concept applies at the component level. In the following example, the container might need access to deployment pipelines to get its configuration. These access needs require **resource identity**. Learn more: [Connecting and authenticating to data sources - Power Platform | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com//power-platform/admin/security/connect-data-sources)

Here's an example of how identity can be implemented in an architecture: 

![A diagram that shows Power Platform back-end services working with an API Hub/API Management connector to reach external data connectors.](media/identity-access/image1.png)

### Determine actions for authorization

Next, you need to know what each authenticated identity is trying to do so that those actions can be authorized. The actions can be divided by the type of access that they require:

**Data plane access**. Actions that take place in the data plane cause data transfer â€“ for example, an application reading or writing data from Microsoft Dataverse, or writing logs to Application Insights.

**Control plane access**. Actions that take place in the control plane cause a Power Platform resource to be created, modified, or deleted. For example, modifying environment properties, or creating a Data policy.

Applications typically target data plane operations, while operations often access both control and data planes.

### Provide role-based authorization

Based on the responsibility of each identity, authorize actions that should be permitted. **An identity must not be allowed to do more than it needs to do**. Before you set authorization rules, you need to have a clear understanding of who or what is making requests, what that role is allowed to do, and to what extent it can do it. Those factors lead to choices that combine identity, role, and scope.

Consider the following:

Does the workload need to have data plane access to Dataverse for both read and write access?

Does the workload need access to environment properties as well? 

If the identity is compromised by a bad actor, what would the impact to the system be in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability?

##### Role assignment

A role is a _set of permissions_ that's assigned to an identity. Assign roles that only allow the identity to complete the task, and no more. When user's permissions are restricted to their job requirements, it's easier to identify suspicious or unauthorized behavior in the system.

Ask questions like these:

Is read-only access enough?

Does the identity need permissions to delete resources?

Does the role only need access to the records they created?

Is hierarchical access based on the business unit the user is in required?

**Limiting the level of access that users, applications, or services have reduces the potential attack surface.** If you grant only the minimum permissions that are required to perform specific tasks, the risk of a successful attack or unauthorized access is significantly reduced. For example, a developer only needs maker access to the Development environment but not the Production environment, they only need access to create resources but not change environment properties, and they may only need access to read/write data from Dataverse but not change the data model or attributes of the Dataverse table. 

**Avoid permissions that** **target individual** **users.** Granular and custom permissions create complexity and confusion and can become difficult to maintain as users change roles and move across the business, or as new users with similar authentication requirements join the team. This can create a complex legacy configuration that's difficult to maintain and negatively impact both security and reliability.

 **Tradeoff**: A granular access control approach enables better auditing and monitoring of user activities.

**Grant roles that start with least privilege and add more based your operational or data access needs**. Your technical teams must have clear guidance to implement permissions.

### Make conditional access choices

Don't give all identities the same level of access. Base your decisions on two main factors:

**Time**. How long the identity can access your environment.

**Privilege**. The level of permissions.

Those factors aren't mutually exclusive. A compromised identity that has more privileges and unlimited duration of access can gain more control over the system and data or use that access to continue to change the environment. Constrain those access factors both as a preventive measure and to control the blast radius.

_Just in Time (JIT)_ approaches provide the required privileges only when they're needed.

_Just Enough Access (JEA)_ provides only the required privileges.

Although time and privilege are the primary factors, there are other conditions that apply. For example, you can also use the device, network, and location from which the access originated to set policies.

**Use strong controls that filter, detect, and block unauthorized access**, including parameters like user identity and location, device health, workload context, data classification, and anomalies.

For example, your workload might need to be accessed by third-party identities like vendors, partners, and customers. They need the appropriate level of access rather than the default permissions that you provide to full-time employees. Clear differentiation of external accounts makes it easier to prevent and detect attacks that come from these vectors.

### Critical impact accounts

Administrative identities introduce some of the highest impact security risks because the tasks they perform require privileged access to a broad set of these systems and applications. Compromise or misuse can have a detrimental effect on your business and its information systems. Security of administration is one of the most critical security areas.

Protecting privileged access against determined adversaries requires you to take a complete and thoughtful approach to isolate these systems from risks. Here are some strategies:

**Minimize the number of critical impact accounts.**

**Use separate roles** instead of elevating privileges for existing identities.

**Avoid permanent or standing access** by using the JIT features of your IdP. For break glass situations, follow an emergency access process.

**Use modern access protocols** like passwordless authentication or multifactor authentication. Externalize those mechanisms to your IdP.

Enforce key security attributes by using **conditional access policies**.

**Decommission administrative accounts** that aren't being used.

### Establish processes to manage the identity lifecycle

**Access to identities must not last longer than the resources that the identities access.** Ensure that you have a process for disabling or deleting identities when there are changes in team structure or software components.

This guidance applies to source control, data, control planes, workload users, infrastructure, tooling, the monitoring of data, logs, metrics, and other entities.

**Establish an identity governance process** to manage the lifecycle of digital identities, high-privileged users, external/guest users, and workload users. Implement access reviews to ensure that when identities leave the organization or the team, their workload permissions are removed.

### Protect nonidentity based secrets

Application secrets like preshared keys should be considered vulnerable points in the system. In the two-way communication, if the provider or consumer is compromised, significant security risks can be introduced. Those keys can also be burdensome because they introduce operational processes.

Treat these secrets as entities that can be dynamically pulled from a secret store. They shouldn't be hard coded in your apps, flows, deployment pipelines, or in any other artifact.

Be sure that you have the **ability to revoke secrets**.

Apply operational practices that handle tasks like **key rotation and expiration**.

For information about rotation policies, see [Automate the rotation of a secret for resources that have two sets of authentication credentials](https://learn.microsoft.com//azure/key-vault/secrets/tutorial-rotation-dual) and [Tutorial: Updating certificate auto-rotation frequency in Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com//azure/key-vault/certificates/tutorial-rotate-certificates).

### Keep development environments safe

**Write access to Developer environments** **should be gated,** **read access to source code should be limited to roles on a need-to-know basis. You should have a process in place that scans resources regularly and identifies the latest vulnerabilities.** 

### Maintain an audit trail

One aspect of identity management is ensuring that the system is auditable. Audits validate whether assume-breach strategies are effective. Maintaining an audit trail helps you:

Verify that identity is authenticated with strong authentication. **Any action must be traceable** to prevent repudiation attacks.

**Detect weak or missing authentication protocols** and get visibility into and insights about user and application sign-ins.

Evaluate access from identities to the workload based on security and **compliance requirements** and consider user account risk, device status, and other criteria and policies that you set.

**Track progress or deviation** from compliance requirements.

Most resources have data plane access. You need to know the identities that access resources and the actions that they perform. You can use that information for security diagnostics.

## Power Platform facilitation

Power Platform access control is a vital part of its overall security architecture. Access control points can ensure that the right users are gaining access to the Power Platform resources. In this section of the paper, we will explore the different access points you can configure and their role in your overall security strategy.

### Microsoft Entra ID

All Power Platform products use Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory or Azure AD) for identity and access management. Entra ID enables organizations to secure and manage identity for their hybrid and multi-cloud environments. Entra ID is also essential for managing business guests needing access to Power Platform resources. Power Platform also uses Entra ID to manage other applications that need to integrate with Power Platform APIs using the service principal capabilities. By using Entra ID, the Power Platform can leverage Entra ID more advanced security features like Conditional Access and continuous access evaluation.

### Azure RBAC

Azure RBAC represents security principals in Microsoft Entra ID. All role assignments are done via Azure RBAC. Take advantage of built-in roles that provide most of the permissions that you need. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra built-in roles](https://learn.microsoft.com//azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference).

Here are some use cases:

By assigning users to roles, you can control access to Azure resources. For more information, see [Overview of role-based access control in Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com//azure/active-directory/roles/custom-overview).

You can use Privileged Identity Management to provide time-based and approval-based role activation for roles that are associated with high-impact identities. For more information, see [What is Privileged Identity Management?](https://learn.microsoft.com//azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure).

For more information about RBAC, see [Best practices for Azure RBAC](https://learn.microsoft.com//azure/role-based-access-control/best-practices).

For information about attribute-based controls, see [What is Azure ABAC?](https://learn.microsoft.com//azure/role-based-access-control/conditions-overview).

### Conditional access policies

**Conditional access describes your policy** for an access decision. To use conditional access, you need to understand the restrictions that are required for the use case. Configure Microsoft Entra Conditional Access by setting up an access policy for that's based on your operational needs.

Granting access to resources unconditionally without regard to the knowledge you have available about the userâ€™s current situation can ignore risks that could otherwise be mitigated. Conditional Access, a feature of Entra ID, brings available signals together to make decisions and enforce policies. Conditional Access policies, at their simplest, are if-then statements; if a user wants to access a resource, then they must complete an action. For example, users must perform multifactor authentication to gain access if they want to access a Power App that tracks a compliance process. 

The following diagram illustrates how signals are used to determine what action must be performed to access the target apps and data. 

![Conceptual Conditional Access process flow.](media/identity-access/image3.png)

Organizations should plan how they intend to use policies to implement their security guidelines. For example, you could use a policy only to let a subset of users use Power Platform, or policies could ensure users can only use Power Platform with specific conditions. For example, the following conditions are part of a policy and could restrict the use of Power Platform when the user is at a higher risk or block it altogether from non-browser clients. 

![A screenshot of a computer screen  Description automatically generated](media/identity-access/image4.png)

Conditional access is very flexible, but that flexibility can also allow you to create policies that have undesirable results or even lock your own admins out. The [planning guide](https://learn.microsoft.com//azure/active-directory/conditional-access/plan-conditional-access) can help your organization think through how to plan for implementing conditional access. 

For more information, see [Conditional access: Users, groups, and workload identities](https://learn.microsoft.com//azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-users-groups).

[Conditional access and multi-factor authentication in Flow - Power Automate | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com//troubleshoot/power-platform/power-automate/conditional-access-and-multi-factor-authentication-in-flow)

### Continuous access

Continuous access accelerates when certain events are evaluated to determine if access should be revoked. Traditionally, with OAuth 2.0 authentication access token expiration is when a check is done during token renewal. With continuous access, a userâ€™s critical events and network location changes are continuously evaluated to determine if the user should still maintain access. These evaluations can result in early termination of active sessions or require reauthentication. For example, if a user account is disabled, they should lose access to the app. Location is also important; for example, the token was authorized from a trusted location, but the user changed their connection to an untrusted network. Continuous access would cause the conditional access policy evaluation, and the user would lose access because they are no longer connecting from an approved location. 

Currently, with Power Platform, only Dataverse supports continuous access evaluation. Microsoft is working to add support to other Power Platform services and clients. 

As organizations continue to embrace hybrid work locations and deploy cloud applications, Entra ID is an essential primary security perimeter protecting users and resources. Conditional access extends that perimeter beyond a network perimeter to include user and device identity. Continuous access ensures that as events or user locations change, access is re-evaluated. Power Platform products' use of Entra ID allows you to implement organization-level security governance that applies consistently across your application portfolio. Review [these](https://learn.microsoft.com//azure/security/fundamentals/identity-management-best-practices) identity management best practices for more guidance you can include in building your own plan for using Entra ID with the Power Platform. 

### Group access management

Instead of granting permissions to specific users, assign access to groups in Microsoft Entra ID. If a group doesn't exist, work with your identity team to create one. You can then add and remove group members outside of Azure and make sure that permissions are current. You can also use the group for other purposes, like mailing lists.

For more information, see [Secure access control using groups in Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com//azure/active-directory/develop/secure-group-access-control).

### Threat detection

Microsoft Entra ID Protection can help you detect, investigate, and remediate identity-based risks. For more information, see [What is Identity Protection?](https://learn.microsoft.com//azure/active-directory/identity-protection/overview-identity-protection).

Threat detection can take the form of reacting to an alert of suspicious activity or proactively searching for anomalous events in activity logs. User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) in Microsoft Sentinel makes it easy to detect suspicious activities. For more information, see [Identify advanced threats with UEBA](https://learn.microsoft.com//azure/sentinel/identify-threats-with-entity-behavior-analytics).

### Identity logging

Activity Logging â€“ Power Apps, Power Automate, Connectors and Data Loss Prevention activity logging are tracked and viewed from the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. [Learn about Microsoft Purview | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com//purview/purview)

Â· Dataverse Auditing - Logs changes that are made to customer records in an environment with a Dataverse database. Dataverse auditing also logs user access through an app or through the SDK in an environment. This auditing is enabled at the environment level, and additional configuration is required for individual tables and columns.

### Service admin roles

Entra ID contains a set of pre-established admin roles that can be assigned to administrators to allow them to have permission to perform administrative tasks. Most organizations wonâ€™t want to assign the Microsoft global admin privilege to all admins, especially if the scope of their administrative tasks is just Power Platform. The following are the two admin roles you can assign to administrators who need to perform Power Platform admin tasks: 

**Power Platform administrator** â€“ Can perform admin functions in Microsoft Power Platform and are not affected by security group membership at the environment level. <br> 

**Dynamics 365 administrator** - Can perform admin functions in Microsoft Power Platform but are affected by security group membership at the environment level. These admins need to be explicitly added to the environmentâ€™s security group to allow them to administer the environment. 

Both service admin roles cannot do functions that are restricted to the Microsoft 365 global admin, such as managing user accounts, managing subscriptions and access settings for Microsoft 365 apps like Microsoft Exchange or SharePoint. Admins will need additional roles if they need to perform those tasks. You can review the [permission matrix](https://learn.microsoft.com//power-platform/admin/use-service-admin-role-manage-tenant) for a more granular breakdown of each roleâ€™s privileges. 

Privileged Identity Management (PIM), a feature of Microsoft Entra ID, can enable you to manage, control, and monitor the use of these high-privilege roles. PIM can provide just-in-time access to these roles and can incorporate your policies and procedures, including approvals and justifications. Using PIM with Power Platform is in public preview, and you can follow its general availability target on the [release plan](https://learn.microsoft.com//power-platform/release-plan/2023wave2/power-platform-governance-administration/improve-security-privileged-identity-management). 

The [CoE Starter Kit](https://aka.ms/coestarterkit) can help you identify users with elevated permissions (system administrators) across all environments in one place, and with this overview allows you to audit if all permissions are still relevant and required or if they could be removed. 

### Securing Dataverse data

One of the key features of Dataverse is its rich security model that can adapt to many business usage scenarios. This security model is only available when a Dataverse database is in the environment. As a security professional, you likely will not be building the entire security model yourself but can often be involved in making sure the use of the security features is consistent with the data security requirements of the organization. 

**Role-based security** 

Dataverse uses role-based security to group together a collection of privileges.  These security roles can be associated directly with users, or they can be associated with Dataverse teams and business units.  

Users can then be associated with the team, and therefore, all users associated with the team will benefit from the role.  A key concept of Dataverse security to understand is that all privilege grants are cumulative, with the greatest amount of access prevailing.  Simply put, if you gave broad organization-level read access to all contact records, you canâ€™t go back and hide a single record. 

Dataverse teams can be associated with Entra ID security groups or Microsoft 365 groups.  When this association is established, the members of the Dataverse team are automatically managed by the system.  Upon first use of an application that depends on this security, the user is automatically added to the Dataverse team.   

Additionally, Dataverse security roles can be configured to treat the role like it was directly assigned to the user. This allows the user to gain user level privileges even though they acquired them via their association with a Dataverse team.  

To make this easier to configure, when you share a canvas app with an Entra ID security group, you will be able to select the Dataverse security roles necessary to use the app.  The system will then automatically create a Dataverse team for you and associate it with the Entra ID security group.  The new team will also be automatically associated with the Dataverse security roles you chose.  This simplifies the admin experience and makes this a good way to manage user security while minimizing manual effort to configure. 

Security is a complex topic and is best accomplished as a combined effort between the application makers, the security team, and the team administering the userâ€™s permissions. Any major changes should be coordinated well in advance of deploying the changes into the environment. 

Securely access data using Customer Lockbox

Microsoft personnel donâ€™t require access to an organizationâ€™s customer data for daily operations. To support some troubleshooting scenarios, the engineer may need access to customer data to be more effective in resolving a problem. The need for access could be in response to a customer-initiated support ticket or a problem identified by Microsoft. The Customer Lockbox feature of Power Platform puts in place a process for Microsoft personnel to request access to customer data. Lockbox requests are reviewed and

approved by your global admins or Power Platform admins. All lockbox requests are tracked and stored for later review and audit.

You can enable the lockbox feature at the tenant level in the Power Platform admin portal. Once enabled, the Customer Lockbox policy will be enforced on any Managed Environments. Power Platform and Dynamics 365 services store customer data using several Azure storage technologies. When you turn on the Customer Lockbox for an environment, customer data associated with the respective environment is protected by the lockbox policy, irrespective of the storage type. There are a few scenarios where lockbox requests arenâ€™t triggered, like emergency events or external legal demands. For support requests where a copy of the environment is made to a special support environment, lockbox requests are triggered just like they would have been in the original environment when the engineer requests access to the data in the support environment.

## Example

The following example shows an identity implementation. Different types of identities are used together to provide the required levels of access.

### Identity components

**System-managed identities**. Microsoft Entra ID provides access to service data planes that don't face users, like Azure Key Vault and data stores. These identities also control access, via RBAC, to the Azure management plane for workload components, deployment agents, and team members.

**Workload identities**. The application services in the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster use workload identities to authenticate themselves to other components in the solution.

**Managed identities**. System components in the client role use system-managed identities, including build agents.

**Human identities**. User and operator authentication is delegated to Microsoft Entra ID or Microsoft Entra ID (native, B2B, or B2C).

The security of preshared secrets is critical for any application. Azure Key Vault provides a secure storage mechanism for these secrets, including Redis and third-party secrets.

A rotation mechanism is used to help ensure that secrets aren't compromised. Tokens for the Microsoft identity platform implementation of OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect are used to authenticate users.

Azure Policy is used to ensure that identity components like Key Vault use RBAC instead of access policies. JIT and JEA provide traditional standing permissions for human operators.

Access logs are enabled across all components via Azure Diagnostics, or via code for code components.
