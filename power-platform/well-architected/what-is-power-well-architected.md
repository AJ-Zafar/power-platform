# What is Power Well-Architected?

Power Well-Architected is a framework that can improve the quality of a low-code workload by helping it to:

- Be reliable.
- Be as secure as you need it to be.
- Support responsible development and operations.
- Be easy to use and accomplish its purposes.

Power Well-Architected is founded on four pillars of architectural excellence, which are mapped to the goals. The pillars are: [Reliability](./reliability/index.yml), [Security](./security/index.yml), [Operational Excellence](./operational-excellence/index.yml), and [Experience Optimization](./experience-optimization/index.yml).

Each pillar provides recommended practices, risk considerations, and tradeoffs. The design decisions must be balanced across all pillars, given the business requirements. The technical and actionable guidance is broad enough for all workloads and applies to a specific scenario. This guidance is centered on Azure.

Workload architecture isn't the same as its implementation. Power Well-Architected can set you up for success through architectural design, but the implementation choices depend on the business requirements and constraints of your organization.

## Pillars

Pillars are the foundation of Power Well-Architected. They are the high-level areas of focus that are critical to the success of a workload.

1. Start your journey with the **Design principles**. Each principle has a specific goal. For each principle, follow the approaches to craft your design strategy. These approaches are not optional.

2. Next, move on to the **Checklist**, which is your starting point for evaluation. Each item on the checklist includes one or more Recommendation guides.

3. Visit each **Recommendation guide**, which describes key strategies to help you attain the goals of the recommendation.

Each architectural decision entails a series of considerations. These **tradeoffs** represent recognized and accepted compromises that balance the various aspects of the framework.
