# What is Power Platform Well-Architected?

Power Platform Well-Architected is a framework that can improve the quality of a low-code workload by helping it to:

- Be reliable.
- Be secure.
- Support responsible development and operations.
- Be easy to use.

Power Platform Well-Architected is built on four pillars of architectural excellence, which are mapped to the goals. The pillars are: [**Reliability**](./reliability/index.yml), [**Security**](./security/index.yml), [**Operational Excellence**](./operational-excellence/index.yml), and [Experience Optimization](./experience-optimization/index.yml).

Each pillar offers best practices, risk factors, and tradeoffs. The design choices must consider all pillars, based on the business needs. The technical and practical guidance is general enough for all workloads and relevant to a specific situation. This guidance focuses on Power Platform.  

Workload architecture differs from its execution. Power Platform Well-Architected can help you achieve optimal architectural design, but the execution options depend on the business goals and limitations of your organization.

## Pillars

Pillars are the foundation of Power Platform Well-Architected. They are the high-level areas of focus that are critical to the success of a workload.

1. Start your journey with the **Design principles**. Each principle has a specific goal. For each principle, follow the approaches to craft your design strategy. These approaches are not optional.

2. Next, move on to the **Checklist**, which is your starting point for evaluation. Each item on the checklist includes one or more Recommendation guides.

3. Visit each **Recommendation guide**, which describes key strategies to help you attain the goals of the recommendation.

Each architectural decision entails a series of considerations. These **tradeoffs** represent recognized and accepted compromises that balance the various aspects of the framework.
