# Experience Optimization design principles 

The **design principles** are intended to provide guidance for aspects of Experience Optimization that you should consider throughout the development lifecycle. Start with the recommended approaches and **justify the benefits for a set of requirements**. After you set your strategy, drive actions by using the [**Experience Optimization checklist**](./checklist.md).

## Design for the user

|![Goal icon](../_images/goal.svg) Put the user at the center and understand their behaviors, needs, and preferences.  |

## Design for simplicity

|![Goal icon](../_images/goal.svg) Make the workload easy to use. Minimize complexity and ensure a user-friendly experience.|
|--|

Simplicity helps users learn the system, perform their tasks, and achieve their goals with minimal distractions.

|Approach|Benefit|
|-|-|
|Follow established conventions and patterns. Use common and recognizable icons, symbols, and layouts. Follow the standards and guidelines of the platform. Leverage the existing mental models and expectations of the users. | Users learn the interface quickly, use it intuitively, and trust its reliability.|
|Provide intuitive navigation. Use a logical and hierarchical structure, provide clear labels and feedback, and offer easy ways to undo, go back, or exit.|Users find what they need, know where they are, and navigate the interface with ease.|
|Use clear and consistent language. Use simple and familiar words, avoid jargon and ambiguity, and use consistent terminology throughout the interface. |Users understand the information and instructions.|
|Focus on the most important information and actions. Eliminate any elements, features, or fields that are not needed. |Users focus on the important elements, scan and read the content easily, and avoid distractions and overload.<br/>The design is aesthetically pleasing and usability is improved. |

## Design for consistency

|![Goal icon](../_images/goal.svg) Experiences should be cohesive and predictable. |
|--|

Create experiences that are easy to use and understand.

## Design for efficiency

|![Goal icon](../_images/goal.svg) Reduce friction and streamline the user experience. |
|--|

Users of the workload should accomplish tasks efficiently, with minimal frustration.

|Approach|Benefit|
|-|-|
|Design workflows and processes to be straightforward and intuitive. Minimize the number of steps required to complete tasks. | Users accomplish their goals faster and with less frustration.<br/>Users commit fewer errors.|
|Optimize interaction design to reduce the time and effort required for users to perform common actions, such as filling out forms or making selections.| Benefit |
|Optimize the user interface and the user flow. Provide a simple, intuitive, and consistent interface that follows the relevant design conventions and standards. The workload experience should also have a logical and coherent user flow that guides users through the process and provides feedback and confirmation.| Benefit |
|Provide clear and consistent feedback. Inform users about the status, results, or errors of their actions, use progress indicators for long-running tasks, and acknowledge user input promptly.|Users understand what is happening, monitor their progress, and recover from errors.| Benefit |
|Prioritize tasks and features based on user needs and frequency of use, ensuring that commonly performed actions are easily accessible and efficient to execute.| Benefit |
|Adapt to the user's context and needs. Optimize the interface for different screen sizes, orientations, and resolutions. Use adaptive design to customize the interface for different devices, platforms, or environments.Use personalization to tailor the interface for different preferences, goals, or behaviors.|Users access the workload in the context that suits them best. |

## Design for scalability

|![Goal icon](../_images/goal.svg) Design a flexible architecture that can handle growth and change. |
|--|

Design the workload to be built to change and built to last.
