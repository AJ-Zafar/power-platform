# Experience Optimization design principles 

The **design principles** are intended to provide guidance for aspects of Experience Optimization that you should consider throughout the development lifecycle. Start with the recommended approaches and **justify the benefits for a set of requirements**. After you set your strategy, drive actions by using the [**Experience Optimization checklist**](./checklist.md).

## Design for the user

## Design for simplicity

|![Goal icon](../_images/goal.svg) Make the workload easy to use. |
|--|

Simplicity helps users learn the system, perform their tasks, and achieve their goals with minimal distractions.Eliminate any elements, features, or fields that are not needed. Focus on the most important information and actions to reduce complexity and provide a user-friendly experience.  Prioritize essential information and actions to minimize complexity and ensure a user-friendly experience.

|Approach|Benefit|
|-|-|
|Provide intuitive navigation. Use a logical and hierarchical structure, provide clear labels and feedback, and offer easy ways to undo, go back, or exit.|Users find what they need, know where they are, and navigate the interface with ease.|
|Use clear and consistent language. Use simple and familiar words, avoid jargon and ambiguity, and use consistent terminology throughout the interface. |This helps users understand the information and instructions, and reduces confusion and errors.|
|Reduce visual clutter. Use whitespace, alignment, contrast, and hierarchy to create a clean and organized layout, avoid unnecessary graphics, animations, or decorations, and use color and typography strategically. |This helps users focus on the important elements, scan and read the content easily, and avoid distractions and overload.|

## Design for consistency

## Design for efficiency

|![Goal icon](../_images/goal.svg) Reduce friction and streamline the user experience. |
|--|

Users of the workload should accomplish tasks efficiently, with minimal frustration. 

|Approach|Benefit|
|-|-|
|Follow established conventions and patterns. Use common and recognizable icons, symbols, and layouts, follow the standards and guidelines of the platform or device, and leverage the existing mental models and expectations of the users. |This helps users learn the interface quickly, use it intuitively, and trust its reliability.|
