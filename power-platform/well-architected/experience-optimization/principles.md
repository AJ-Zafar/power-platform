# Experience Optimization design principles 

The **design principles** are intended to provide guidance for aspects of Experience Optimization that you should consider throughout the development lifecycle. Start with the recommended approaches and **justify the benefits for a set of requirements**. After you set your strategy, drive actions by using the [**Experience Optimization checklist**](./checklist.md).

## Design for the user

|![Goal icon](../_images/goal.svg) Put the user at the center and understand their behaviors, needs, and preferences.  |
|--|

Description of principle.

|Approach|Benefit|
|-|-|
|Learn about what users want, need, and struggle with through user research and empathy-building methods. Imagine yourself as a user to understand their experiences and views, guiding design choices that meet their needs well.|Summary of benefit.|
|Focus on user needs and preferences in every stage of the design process, making users the main drivers of decision-making. Design solutions that match user objectives, processes, and ways of thinking, making sure that users can perform tasks quickly and easily.|Summary of benefit.|
|Make sure that your workload can be used by users with different abilities, including those who have disabilities. Follow accessibility guidelines and standards when designing to meet the varied needs of users.| Summary of benefit.|
|Design experiences that are inclusive and suit users with different backgrounds, cultures, and contexts. Think about factors like language, cultural expectations, and digital skills to make sure that interfaces are easy to use and meaningful for everyone.|
|Maintain consistency in design and functionality across different platforms and devices. Design interfaces that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes, resolutions, and input methods, providing users with a consistent experience regardless of the device they use.|Summary of benefit.|

## Design for simplicity

|![Goal icon](../_images/goal.svg) Make the workload easy to use. Minimize complexity and ensure a user-friendly experience.|
|--|

Simplicity helps users learn the system, perform their tasks, and achieve their goals with minimal distractions.

|Approach|Benefit|
|-|-|
|Create a coherent and logical structure of information, content, and functionality in the interface.| Users quickly understand the interface and are able to locate the functionality relevant to their tasks.<br><br>Users can process information more efficiently and make informed decisions without being overwhelmed.<br><br>Streamlined interactions are more accessible and ensure users can navigate the interface more effectively. |
|Provide an intuitive and consistent interface that follows relevant design conventions and standards. Leverage the existing mental models and expectations of the users. | Users can easily figure out how to use the workload without spending a lot of time or effort in learning new interactions or workflows. This faster learning speeds up user onboarding and adoption.<br/><br/>Users have a feeling of consistency as they experience design elements and interactions that they have recognized and used before. This consistency lowers mental effort and makes it simpler for users to comprehend and navigate the interface.<br/><br/>There is uniformity across interfaces, both within a workload and across different workloads. Uniform design elements and interactions facilitate the learning and usage of the interface for users, regardless of their prior experience.|
|Focus on the most important information and actions. Eliminate any elements, features, or fields that are not needed. |Users access and consume information effectively, resulting in better-informed interactions and improved satisfaction.<br/><br/>Users find the system easy to use and are more likely to engage with the workload, leading to higher adoption rates and better utilization. |

## Design for efficiency

|![Goal icon](../_images/goal.svg) Reduce friction and streamline the user experience. |
|--|

The workload must be designed such that users accomplish tasks efficiently, with minimal frustration. Ensuring users are able to get their work done increases their satisfaction and realizes higher ROI.

|Approach|Benefit|
|-|-|
|Design workflows and processes to be straightforward and intuitive. Minimize the number of steps required to complete tasks. | Users accomplish more in less time.<br/><br/>The risks of errors is reduced, leading to improved accuracy and reliability.<br/><br/>Operational expenses are lowered through efficiency improvements.|
|Optimize interaction design to reduce the time and effort required for users to perform common actions, such as filling out forms or making selections.| Users complete the objectives more quickly.<br/><br/>Task completion rates go up and the need for user support goes down.<br/><br/>Users feel a greater sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. |
|Provide clear and consistent feedback. Inform users about the status, results, or errors of their actions, use progress indicators for long-running tasks, and acknowledge user input promptly.|Users understand what is happening, monitor their progress, and recover from errors.<br/><br/>Users know that the system has seen and handled their actions, making them more trustful of the interface.<br/><br/>Users feel more at ease when they get instant feedback, knowing that their input has been accepted.<br/><br/>Users move through complex processes or new interfaces with assurance.<br/><br/>Error messages provide instructions or suggestions for corrective actions, helping users troubleshoot problems efficiently. |
|Prioritize tasks and features based on user needs and frequency of use, ensuring that commonly performed actions are easily accessible and efficient to execute.| Task prioritization helps users concentrate on the most important and effective activities, minimizing interruptions and mental stress. Clear prioritization directs users to the actions that have the most impact, simplifying their workflow and improving their overall experience.<br/><br/>By putting the most important tasks first, users can see what actions they need to take more clearly. Users can choose faster and with more confidence, leading to less time spent on decisions and better usability.<br/><br/>Workload teams can use resources wisely by working on tasks or features that benefit users the most. Workload teams can increase the effect of their efforts and resources, leading to better results and ROI.|
