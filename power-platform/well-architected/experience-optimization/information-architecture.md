# Recommendations for implementing an information architecture

**Applies to this Power Well-Architected Experience Optimization checklist recommendation:**

|[EO:01](checklist.md)| **TODO** Update with checklist details for this item |
|---|---|

This guide describes the recommendations for designing an effective information architecture (IA) for your project. Any high-quality user experience starts with the foundation of a well-planned information architecture. Information architecture is how you organize your content to be consumable and sustainable. Well-planned information architectures greatly benefit both users and product-makers by reducing overhead and ensuring effective user experience.

**Product-makers**
- Balances project requirements and user needs.
- Helps with where and how to place new content without disrupting existing content and site structure.
- Minimizes impact of bias and politics that may surface during development.
- Leverages IAs to generate wireframes and a sitemap of the project

**Users**
- Helps create effective and optimal experiences.
- Allows them to effortlessly understand content, especially when using for the first time

## Key design strategies

A successful IA is made up of four systems that are ultimately applied to the user interface:
1. **Labeling systems**. How information is represented.
1. **Organization systems**. How information is structured.
1. **Search systems**. How users look for information.
1. **Navigation systems**.  How users browse or move through information.

- **Content**. What you have, what you should have, and what you need.
- **Context**. The business or personal goals for the project, stakeholders, and constraints.
- **Users**. What they need to do, how they think, what do they already know.

Without a good understanding of these three things, you can’t create an effective IA.
If you don’t know enough about users, you won’t be able to make your experience easy to use.
If you don’t know about context, you won’t be able to create something that works for people, the business, and problems will plague your project.

Information ecology describes how systems of information that go into an IA are all interdependent of each other.
| System | Summary | Consequence of disregarding |
| ------ | ---------- | --------------------------- |
| Content | What you have, what you should have, and what you need. | IA will not be flexible and futureproof. |
| Context | The business or personal goals for the project, stakeholders, and constraints. | IA will be ineffective, the project may fail to meet business goals, and problems will persist long-term. |
| Users | What end-users need to do, how they think, and what they already know. | The user experience will not be easy to use and adopt. | 


### Define and plan the content in scope
Ensure thorough understanding of existing content, align content with user needs and project goals through research and analysis, and facilitate clear communication to effectively manage and optimize website content for improved functionality and user experience.

#### Step 1: Audit content you have
The first step to working with content is to understand what you already have, then determine which content should be used.

:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
      **What you have**
      * Understand the subject (if you are new to it)
      * Look at it with fresh eyes (if you already know it)
      * Clean up out-of-date and inaccurate content
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::
      **What to collect**
      * Collect only what you’ll need, and nothing more
      * Each link's name (the label that will be used in navigation)
      * Page names (main heading on a page, which should be the same as link name)
      * Page url (if applicable)
      * Content type (article, FAQ, report, or something else?)
      * Resources (PDFs, images, videos, etc)
      * Status / date last updated
      * Content owners
      * Comments (anything you want to note)
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

> [!TIP]
> * List each content once, or document cross-links elsewhere if it’s important
> * List all pages, but not always all resources (ie: video, downloadable files, etc)
> * Consider how you'd prepare content for migration and how to track this progress


### Step 2: Identify content you need
Keep in mind the content you choose should meet your users' needs, and also achieve your project goals.

:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
      **Current behavior**
      * Look at what’s being used already, to easily help confirm what you should include or get ideas for content
      * Look at website statistics, both recent and long-term, does usage peak and never get used again?
      * Consider what content is heavily used or popular, and why it's popular
      * If content is important but not getting enough use, consider how you can make it easier to find
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::
      **User research & content brainstorm**
      Leverage your initial research insights about users to prioritize and use the right content. Pay attention to:
      * Gaps in content and uses
      * Ways to improve UX functionality for easier completion of tasks
      * Consider needs for functional items to improve pain points in UX flows such as templates, tools, et cetera
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::
   **Market analysis**
   You can learn a lot by looking at application offerings in the market with similar utility to your project. This provides insight into a perspective other than your own. Consider:
   * Where do they display information?
   * Which information is the common denominator?
   * Is the website or application easy to navigate?
   * What makes it good or bad?
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

### Step 3: Communicating your content
Content shouldn't be treated as an afterthought, because content is the website. Ensure project content is clearly communicated and understood by all important stakeholders from the beginning of the planning throughout.

There are several ways you can communicate your content needs to colleagues without an IA already in place:
- Show what content exists
- discuss what should be deleted or rewritten
- talk about priorities for updating/adding content
- consider content goals, format, length, audiences, accuracy, etc.
- keep a record of content ideas
- manage project activities such as content updates and migration

Displaying this raw data
Leverage your initial user research insights about your users to prioritize and use the right content. Pay attention to:
gaps in content and uses
ways to improve UX functionality for easier completion of tasks
consider needs for functional items to improve painpoints in UX flows such as templates, tools, and such
Quick tips
collaborate closely with content authors (such as designers or writers)
involve your entire team from start to finish
reference user research to target content and key decisions
