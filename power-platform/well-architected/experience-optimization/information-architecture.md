# Recommendations for implementing an information architecture

**Applies to this Power Well-Architected Experience Optimization checklist recommendation:**

|[XO:03](checklist.md)| **Implement a consistent information architecture. Make finding information and functionality easy. Provide contextual clues and visual indicators to guide users. Use consistent and user-friendly labels for categories, navigation, and other informational elements.** |
|---|---|

This guide describes the recommendations for designing an effective information architecture (IA) for your workload.

## Key design strategies

Information architecture is the way the content and features of a system are organized and structured. It affects how users perceive, understand, and navigate the system. A well-architected system should have an information architecture that is based on the user needs and tasks, rather than the system's internal logic or technical constraints. Users should be able to find and access the information and features they need with ease and efficiency.

### Be consistent with navigation structures

Consistent navigation helps users to orient themselves in the workload experience, and to move easily and efficiently between different pages or screens. It should be clear, intuitive, and predictable. Use the same navigation elements, such as menus, tabs, breadcrumbs, and buttons, across your workload, and place them in the same locations. Make sure that the navigation reflects the hierarchy and relationships of your content, and that users can always see where they are and where they can go.

### Use consistent and user-friendly labels

Labels are the words or phrases that you use to name and describe your content and features, such as headings, titles, menus, buttons, and links. Clear and consistent labels help users to understand and easily navigate the workload experience and to perform their tasks effectively. Labels should be consistent in tone, language, and format, and use the terms that your users are familiar with and prefer. For example, if you use the term "account" to refer to the user's profile and settings, use it consistently throughout your workload's experience, and avoid using synonyms like "profile" or "settings".

Navigation elements should have clear and descriptive labels that communicate the purpose and destination of each element. Users should be able to understand what each element does and where it leads without having to click or tap on it. For example, a menu item labeled "Products" is more informative than one labeled "Menu 1".

### Provide contextual clues and visual indicators to guide users

Contextual clues and visual indicators are the elements that help users understand the meaning and function of your content and features, such as icons, labels, colors, fonts, and images. They should be consistent in style, size, and meaning, and match the user's expectations and conventions. For example, if you use an icon of a magnifying glass to represent a search function, use it consistently throughout your product, and make sure it behaves the same way every time.

### Use progressive disclosure

Progressive disclosure helps users to focus on their primary tasks and goals, without being distracted or overwhelmed by secondary or irrelevant information and functionality. Provide the right amount of information and functionality at the right time, using techniques such as hiding, collapsing, expanding, or revealing the content and functionality as needed. Avoid overwhelming or distracting the users with too much or too little information and functionality. Allow users to control the level of detail and complexity they want to see or interact with.

### Categorize information and functionality

Organizing information and functionality into meaningful and logical groups makes it easier for users to find and access the information and features of your workload. Group and label the content and functionality into meaningful and logical categories, based on the users' needs, tasks, and goals. Use categories that are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive, meaning that each item belongs to one and only one category, and that all the items are covered by the categories. Use categories that are coherent and consistent, meaning that the items within each category share a common characteristic or criterion.

### Group information and functionality into hierarchies

Arrange and display the content and functionality in a hierarchical order, based on the importance, frequency, or sequence of use. Use a top-down or a bottom-up approach, depending on the users' preferences and behaviors. Use a shallow or a deep hierarchy, depending on the amount and complexity of the content and functionality. Use visual cues and indicators, such as size, color, shape, or position, to show the hierarchical relationships and levels.
