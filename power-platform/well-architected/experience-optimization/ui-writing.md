## Key design strategies

### Make it scannable, task focused, and contextual 

When using a business application, people aren't interested in the features of the UI or being entertained by flowery language. They're focused on task completion. Help them by writing in short, scannable blocks. Divide text into shorter sentences and paragraphs. Avoid overly gushy language. 

Focus on usability and task completion. The content's primary goal is to aid users in completing their tasks efficiently and effectively. Users often visit a UI with specific objectives in mind, and content should guide them seamlessly toward achieving those objectives.

Be concise: The content is brief and to the point. Avoid unnecessary verbosity or superfluous details. Users typically prefer information that is easy to digest and quickly understandable, enabling efficient information processing. Concise doesn't mean limited; it means efficient. Use as few words as possible without losing the meaning. When writing concisely, make sure every word on the screen has a job. Follow Mark Twain's advice: "Writing is easy. All you have to do is cross out the wrong words."

Speaks in plain language. Use simple, clear language that is easily understood by the target audience, devoid of unnecessary jargon or technical terms. Users should be able to comprehend content effortlessly, reducing the likelihood of confusion or misinterpretation, ultimately improving engagement.

Keeps reading levels no higher than tenth grade. Maintaining an appropriate reading level enhances accessibility and inclusivity, catering to a broader range of users, including those with lower literacy levels or cognitive disabilities.

Includes sentences of 25 words or less. Sentences should be brief and succinct. Short sentences with sufficient information facilitate comprehension, making the content easier to read and understand. 

Promotes accessibility. Accessibility involves ensuring that content is perceivable, operable, and understandable by all users, including those with disabilities. Features such as descriptive alt text for images, proper heading structures, and keyboard navigation options ensures that the UI content can be accessed and utilized by assistive technologies.

Tells people what they need to know. The content should provides users with the essential information required to accomplish their tasks or make informed decisions within the UI. Users rely on content to guide their interactions and expect clear, relevant information that meets their needs. It should never cause confusion or frustration during their user journey.

### Use the appropriate tone for the situation

#### Understand types of statements
How people react to and feel about your product depends partly on the quality of the writing and the overall voice and tone in which you speak. When writing in general, there are four types of statements that you can use. Typically, UI copy uses three of the four, depending on the purpose of the copy and the nature of the product.

- Use _declarative_ statements regularly. A description of the features of a component is an example of when you'd use a declarative statement.
- Use _imperatives_ freely. These are prompts and commands. For example, when asking the reader to review changes and then submit.
- Use caution with _interrogative_ statements (aka questions). They are okay in product flows where people must make choices. They can help uncover solutions or clarify a reader's needs.
- Occasionally, _exclamatory_ statements can be used in UI copy. Just remember, the more you use them, the smaller the positive impact.

#### Know when to use active voice 

In an _active_ voice, the subject performs the action. It starts with the person or thing that's taking the action. 

In passive voice, the subject receives the action. The past participle of the action verb follows some form of the verb to be (e.g., has been, will be). 

For best practices and standards, lean heavily into active voice. For general guidelines and don’ts, use passive voice.
