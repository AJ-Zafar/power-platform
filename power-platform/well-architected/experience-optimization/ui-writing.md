## Key design strategies

### Make it scannable, task focused, and contextual 

When using a business application, people aren't interested in the features of the UI or being entertained by flowery language. They're focused on task completion. Help them by writing in short, scannable blocks. Divide text into shorter sentences and paragraphs. Avoid overly gushy language. 

Focus on usability and task completion. The content's primary goal is to aid users in completing their tasks efficiently and effectively. Users often visit a UI with specific objectives in mind, and content should guide them seamlessly toward achieving those objectives.

Be concise: The content is brief and to the point. Avoid unnecessary verbosity or superfluous details. Users typically prefer information that is easy to digest and quickly understandable, enabling efficient information processing. Concise doesn't mean limited; it means efficient. Use as few words as possible without losing the meaning. When writing concisely, make sure every word on the screen has a job. Follow Mark Twain's advice: "Writing is easy. All you have to do is cross out the wrong words."

Speaks in plain language. Use simple, clear language that is easily understood by the target audience, devoid of unnecessary jargon or technical terms. Users should be able to comprehend content effortlessly, reducing the likelihood of confusion or misinterpretation, ultimately improving engagement.

Keeps reading levels no higher than tenth grade. Maintaining an appropriate reading level enhances accessibility and inclusivity, catering to a broader range of users, including those with lower literacy levels or cognitive disabilities.

Includes sentences of 25 words or less. Sentences should be brief and succinct. Short sentences with sufficient information facilitate comprehension, making the content easier to read and understand. 

Promotes accessibility. Accessibility involves ensuring that content is perceivable, operable, and understandable by all users, including those with disabilities. Features such as descriptive alt text for images, proper heading structures, and keyboard navigation options ensures that the UI content can be accessed and utilized by assistive technologies.

Tells people what they need to know. The content should provides users with the essential information required to accomplish their tasks or make informed decisions within the UI. Users rely on content to guide their interactions and expect clear, relevant information that meets their needs. It should never cause confusion or frustration during their user journey.

### Use the appropriate tone for the situation

#### Understand types of statements
How people react to and feel about your product depends partly on the quality of the writing and the overall voice and tone in which you speak. When writing in general, there are four types of statements that you can use. Typically, UI copy uses three of the four, depending on the purpose of the copy and the nature of the product.

- Use _declarative_ statements regularly. A description of the features of a component is an example of when you'd use a declarative statement.
- Use _imperatives_ freely. These are prompts and commands. For example, when asking the reader to review changes and then submit.
- Use caution with _interrogative_ statements (aka questions). They are okay in product flows where people must make choices. They can help uncover solutions or clarify a reader's needs.
- Occasionally, _exclamatory_ statements can be used in UI copy. Just remember, the more you use them, the smaller the positive impact.

#### Know when to use active voice 

#### Know when to use active voice 

In an _active_ voice, the subject performs the action. It starts with the person or thing that's taking the action. 

In _passive_ voice, the subject receives the action (as opposed to performing it). The past participle of the action verb follows some form of the verb to be (e.g., has been, will be). Unlike active voice, passive voice obscures or omits the actor, making the sentence less direct and sometimes ambiguous.

**Active vs Passive voice examples**

| Active | Passive |
| ------ | ------- |
| "Click the 'Submit' button to save your changes." | "Your changes will be saved when the 'Submit' button is clicked." |
| "Enter your email address to receive updates." | "Updates will be received once the email address is entered." |
| "Select your preferred language from the dropdown menu." | "The preferred language can be selected from the dropdown menu." |
| "Fill out the form with your contact information." | "The form should be filled out with contact information." |
| "Review the terms and conditions before proceeding." | "The terms and conditions should be reviewed before proceeding." |
| "Click on the image to view it in full size." | "The image can be viewed in full size by clicking on it." |

In each of these examples, the active voice provides clear instructions to the user (the subject) by specifying the action they need to take. This clarity helps users understand what they need to do more efficiently as it gives better direction. In the passive examples, no actor is indicated, so it's unclear who should be performing the action on the subject. The user should be aware when they need to take action. 

Passive voice may be more appropriate in user interfaces when the emphasis is on the action or event itself rather than on who performed it. For example, in error messages or system notifications where the focus is on conveying information about what happened rather than assigning blame or responsibility (either on the user or on the system), passive voice can be useful. It may be preferred when the actor is unknown, irrelevant, or intentionally omitted from the message to maintain a neutral tone. Use judiciously, only when it enhances clarity and comprehension.

| Active | Passive | 
| ------ | ------- |
| "You entered the password incorrectly." | "The password was entered incorrectly." |
| "We couldn't find the file." | "The file could not be found." |
| "You submitted the form." | "The form has been submitted." |
| "We encountered an error while processing your request." | "An error occurred while processing your request." |
| "The system failed to activate your account." | "The account activation failed." |
| "We saved the changes." | "The changes have been saved." |

For best practices and standards, lean heavily into active voice. For general guidelines (especially when recommending things to avoid), use passive voice.
