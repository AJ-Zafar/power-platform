This guide describes practices for reducing complexity in the user experience of your workloads. Complex user interfaces present several risks that can hinder user experience and software effectiveness. High complexity can lead to decreased usability as users struggle to understand and navigate the interface efficiently, resulting in frustration and reduced productivity. Complex user interfaces can negatively impact user satisfaction, productivity, and accessibility, ultimately diminishing the effectiveness and success of the software application.

## Design strategies

User interface complexity is determined by the level of challenge and cognitive demand experienced by users when interacting with a software application. It encompasses factors such as the variety of form fields, the volume and organization of information, the clarity of feedback, the simplicity of navigation, and the visual appeal of the layout. This complexity influences the usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction of the application, as well as impacting user performance and error rates. Therefore, it is crucial to design interfaces that strike a balance between functionality and complexity, meeting the needs and expectations of users.
