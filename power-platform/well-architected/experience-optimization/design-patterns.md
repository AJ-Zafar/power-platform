# Design patterns that support experience optimization

When you design workload architectures, you should use industry patterns that address common challenges. Patterns can help you make intentional tradeoffs within workloads and optimize for your desired outcome. They can also help mitigate risks that originate from specific problems, which can impact reliability, security, performance, and experience.

## Design patterns for experience optimization

The following table summarizes the design patterns that support the goals of experience optimization.
