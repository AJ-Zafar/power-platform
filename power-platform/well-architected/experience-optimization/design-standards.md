# Recommendations for following design standards

**Applies to this Power Well-Architected Experience Optimization checklist recommendation:**

This guide shows how to apply established design standards, conventions, and best practices to develop user interfaces that are effective and professional, enhancing the user experience and the application’s overall success. Deviating from standards may be needed in certain circumstances but should be carefully thought through to avoid negatively affecting the user's experience and ensure optimal outcomes.

## Key design strategies

Following design standards helps reduce decision-making effort in the design process by identifying the important aspects of design that should be considered. Understanding the standards itemize and streamline a team's ability to achieve well-designed user interfaces. This results in faster development cycles, improved usability, and enhanced user satisfaction, ultimately leading to increased productivity and effectiveness for internal software systems.

### Understand design principles

Certain truths about human cognition have been heavily researched and help make informed decisions about visual design and how people interact with digital products. This knowledge supports many of the specific best practices and standards, which may only provide solutions for about 80% of the final product. Design principles can help bridge the remaining 20% creative gap that doesn’t have a clear-cut answer available from standards. Getting familiar with this knowledge helps development teams understand design considerations when planning and can reduce dependency on, or improve collaboration with, design resources.

### Use common patterns and metaphors

Universal patterns and metaphors have been established that the general population of digital products have become accustomed to and expect. Ensuring your design includes these patterns where applicable will make your application easier for users to onboard and use long term, reduce training (or support) costs, and even potentially reduce effort that might be required to update the design.

### Use a design system

A design system is a framework that provides design principles, visual language, components, patterns, and guidance for designers and developers to utilize. Microsoft uses the Fluent UI design system for Power Platform modern controls, so learning to navigate its design system will help understand the correct usage of its components. All modern Microsoft products use the same design system and serve as an extended example of recommendations and inspiration for design practices.

### Follow component design guidelines

Design systems such as Fluent UI invest a significant amount of research and development effort into creating components to ensure they meet the needs of end users. They are also designed in a way that can be ubiquitous and easily utilized across various digital products and platforms. Each component has specific guidelines to ensure usage is in line with the intension, to take advantage of the consistent nature components offer.

### Establish organizational standards

Integrate design standards based on company style guides and branding. Ensure that all team members are aware of and adhere to the established standards throughout the project lifecycle.

### Mitigate deviations

Proactively identify and address any deviations from design standards to prevent potential negative impacts on user experience and application success. Deviations can lead to confusion, frustration, and increased development costs, so it's essential to mitigate them early in the design process by providing access to design resources. Ideally, having a system that can validate whether design standards are being met across an organization, such as having a regularly scheduled design office hour with people who can help validate standards are being met, can benefit the team to scale out standards in an organization.

## Power Platform facilitation
