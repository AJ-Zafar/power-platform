# Recommendations for creating a culture of user advocacy

**Applies to this Power Well-Architected Experience Optimization checklist recommendation:**

|[EO:01](checklist.md)| Develop a culture of user advocacy. Ensure that design outcomes meet the expectations and requirements of the users of the workload. Reduce costs and risks of design failures, redesigns, and maintenance. |

This guide describes the recommendations for creating, developing, and nurturing a culture of advocacy for the user

## Key design strategies

These design strategies are not linear or sequential, but rather iterative and cyclical, meaning that they can be repeated and refined throughout the design process, based on the feedback and learning from each stage.

### Involve the workload users throughout the lifecycle

Workload teams should not only research and understand the needs, goals, and preferences of the users, but also involve them in the process of creating solutions that meet those needs. To include the users in the lifecycle, consider these strategies:

- Conduct user research at the early stages of the workload development cycle, to identify the user problems, opportunities, and requirements.
- Co-create and co-design with the users, by inviting them to participate in brainstorming sessions, workshops, and design sprints, where they can share their ideas, feedback, and opinions.
- Prototype and test with the users, by creating low-fidelity or high-fidelity prototypes of the proposed solutions and testing them with the users, to validate the assumptions, hypotheses, and design decisions.
- Launch and iterate with the users, by releasing the minimum viable product (MVP) or the beta version of the workload to a subset of the users, and collecting their feedback and usage data, to measure the impact and performance of the workload, and make improvements based on the findings.

### Conduct user research and share the insights

Conducting user research for a well-architected workload is an essential step in understanding user needs, preferences, and behaviors to inform design decisions effectively. User research can be done through various methods, such as interviews, surveys, observations, usability testing, and analytics. User research helps to define the problem space, identify user segments and personas, and create user scenarios and journeys.

- *Clearly define the objectives of the research*: Ensure that the objectives align with the overall project goals and desired outcomes for the workload, as well as the expectations of the users and stakeholders.

- *Select the research methods*: Identify and choose the research methods that work best for the users of your workload, such as interviews, surveys, observations, or usability testing. These methods should be chosen based on the research objectives and available resources. A well-defined research plan outlines the approach, methodology, timeline, and logistics, while also preparing necessary materials such as interview guides, survey questions, or usability test scenarios.

- *Recruit participants*: Aim to include individuals who represent the target audience with diversity in contexts, skills, and experience. During research sessions, maintaining a neutral and non-leading approach is crucial to gather unbiased insights. Collect qualitative and/or quantitative data during these sessions, and capture user feedback, observations, and interactions with the solution.

- *Analyze findings*: Identify patterns, themes, and insights that emerge from the research analysis. Employ techniques such as thematic coding or affinity mapping to organize and interpret the data effectively. Use key insights extracted from the research findings to inform design decisions and address user needs, pain points, and preferences.

- *Communicate the findings*: Document the research findings, insights, and recommendations in a clear and actionable format. Share the research findings with stakeholders, users, and other relevant parties to foster understanding and alignment.

### Empathize with the users and their contexts

Empathizing with users and their contexts helps the workload team to understand the user's needs, problems, expectations, and motivations, and to design experiences that are relevant, useful, usable, and desirable. Empathizing with users and their contexts also helps to avoid making assumptions or biases about the user's behavior, preferences, or values, and to discover insights and opportunities that might otherwise be overlooked or ignored.

**Create user personas** to synthesize the research data into fictional but realistic profiles of the target users that describe their characteristics, goals, needs, pain points, motivations, and behaviors. User personas should be based on evidence and data, not assumptions or stereotypes, and should represent the diversity and complexity of the user population. User personas should also include relevant quotes, stories, or scenarios that illustrate the user's context and experience. User personas should be used to guide the design decisions and to evaluate the workload from the user's perspective.

**Create scenarios** to describe the situations or tasks that the user personas encounter or perform, in relation to the workload. Scenarios should capture the user's goals, actions, emotions, and expectations, as well as the challenges or barriers they face, and the outcomes they achieve. Scenarios should be realistic and specific, and should reflect the user's context and environment. Scenarios should be used to explore the user's needs and requirements, and to identify the opportunities and gaps for design improvement.

**Create journey maps** to visualize the user personas' end-to-end experience with the workload, across different touchpoints, channels, and stages. Journey maps should illustrate the user's journey from their initial problem or need, to their final goal or satisfaction, and should highlight the user's thoughts, feelings, and pain points along the way. Journey maps should also include the user's actions, interactions, and feedback, as well as the workload's features, functions, and performance. Journey maps should be used to empathize with the user's experience, and to discover the pain points and opportunities for design enhancement.

Empathizing with users and their contexts also helps to build trust and rapport with the users, and further ensures their involvement in, and contribution to, the design process.

### Provide user education and support

- Documentation
- Training
- In-app guidance
- Feedback mechanisms

### Encourage continuous improvement

Embrace a culture of continuous improvement by soliciting feedback, conducting regular evaluations, and incorporating lessons learned into future projects. Stay updated with the latest trends in UX design from authorities in the design space who have invested in research. Look to modern Microsoft product interface implementation for inspiration and latest trends in the Fluent UI space. Continuous improvement ensures that your designs evolve alongside changing user needs and industry trends, maintaining relevance and effectiveness over time.

Iterate and improve solutions by testing the workload. Testing should involve observing and measuring the user's behavior, reactions, feedback, and satisfaction, as well as the workload's usability, functionality, and quality. Testing should be done in an iterative manner, using different methods and tools, such as prototypes, surveys, interviews, analytics, or usability tests, depending on the stage and scope of the design process. Testing should be used to evaluate the workload's performance and value, and to validate or invalidate the design assumptions and hypotheses.

Analyze and synthesize the test results, by organizing, interpreting, and presenting the data and insights that were collected from the testing phase. Analysis and synthesis should involve identifying the patterns, trends, and themes that emerge from the data, and drawing the conclusions and implications for the design decisions and solutions. Analysis and synthesis should also involve comparing and contrasting the test results with the initial user needs and requirements, and highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the workload. Analysis and synthesis should be used to generate actionable recommendations and suggestions for design improvement and refinement.

Implement and communicate the design improvements, by applying the changes and modifications that were suggested by the test results and analysis, and by documenting and sharing the design process and outcomes with the relevant stakeholders. Implementation and communication should involve updating and enhancing the workload based on the user feedback and data, and ensuring that the workload meets the user's expectations and goals. Implementation and communication should also involve creating and delivering the design artifacts and deliverables, such as wireframes, mockups, prototypes, or specifications, that demonstrate the design solutions and rationale. Implementation and communication should be used to finalize and launch the workload, and to showcase the design value and impact.
