This guide describes the recommendations for improving usability in user interface design. Usability refers to the ease of use and effectiveness of a product for its intended users. It's crucial because it directly impacts user satisfaction, errors, and overall interactions with the digital interface, ultimately affecting the success of an application.

## Key design strategies

Usability is a quality attribute that assesses how easy user interfaces are to use. The word "usability" also refers to methods for improving ease-of-use during the design process.

Usability is defined by 5 quality components:

| Component | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Learnability | How easy tasks can be attained during the first usage and how quickly users learn from the previous experience? |
| Efficiency | Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks? |
| Memorability | When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they reestablish proficiency? |
| Errors | How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they recover from the errors? |
| Satisfaction | How pleasant is it to use the design? |

Consider these strategies for ensuring usability for your workload:

### Visibility of system status

The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable time.

Use progress indicators or loading animations to reassure users that their request is being processed. This helps prevent frustration from uncertainty and manages expectations, otherwise users may perceive the system as slow or unresponsive and abandon the task.

Provide real-time updates to keep users engaged and informed about the outcome of their actions. This prevents confusion or doubt about whether an action was successful or not, potentially resulting in errors or repetitive actions. Utilize status messages or notifications to clearly communicate successful actions or errors. Any important information that is overlooked could result in errors or misunderstandings down the line.

Incorporate color-coded indicators on different states for quick recognition and understanding of system status. Color is processed faster than text due to its direct neural pathway and evolutionary significance, while also providing an ability to evoke emotional associations, further enhancing user's ability to comprehend information quickly and intuitively. Reading text requires cognitive processing involving language comprehension and interpretation, a much longer neural pathway which takes more time and effort compared to the immediate recognition of colors.

Allow users to track progress of ongoing tasks to enhance transparency and empower users to manage their time effectively.

Prioritize accessibility in system status design as these are the more critical elements of the experience to understand.

### Match between system and the real world

The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.

Employ terminology and concepts that are familiar to users and avoid jargon that may alienate them. People quickly grasp the purpose and functionality of a system when it speaks their language. Aligning system terminology with everyday language helps users feel understood and catered to, which can influence positive perceptions of the app.

Structure system information in a manner that mirrors scenarios and conventions users understand to help them easily navigate the interface without having to spend time deciphering unfamiliar layouts. Present information in a natural and logical sequence that resonates with users' expectations. Emulate familiar real-world processes to facilitate intuitive navigation and interaction within the system to reduce the liklihood of errors or misunderstandings.

### User control and freedom

Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.

Supporting various input methods accomodates users with different preferences and accessibility needs. Offering options like keyboard shortcuts, touch gestures, voice commands, or mouse clicks ensures that users can interact with the interface using their preferred method. Furthermore, allowing users to configure input settings, such as sensitivity or response time, empowers them to fine-tune their interaction experience to match their comfort level and usage patterns. Flexible input methods promote inclusivity and usability, enabling all users to engage with the interface effectively.

Providing granular control over data and privacy settings is paramount for respecting user autonomy and fostering trust. Adjusting privacy settings, deleting or exporting data, and controlling access permissions for third-party applications ensures users can maintain control over their information. Offering clear explanations and transparent disclosures about data collection practices, security measures, and user rights enables informed decision-making and promotes transparency and accountability.

### Consistency and standards

Maintain consistency in design to ensure users can easily recognize and understand status indicators, reducing cognitive load and improving usability. Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. 

If repeatable experience patterns appear differnt, users will struggle to interpret the meaning of the variation introduced, leading to inefficiencies in understanding and task completion. Using the matching suite of controls (e.g., all modern controls or all legacy) helps ensure visual elements are consistent. Utilize component libraries or Power Apps component framework to ensure consistency for more complex or composite repeatable experience patterns.

### Error prevention

Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.

Proactively address potential issues in the interface to maintain workflow continuity. For complex systems, it can be helpful defining a model that describes the dynamics of the system, which captures the relationships between the system's variables and how they evolve based on different values. Gather values and constraints for each variable (e.g., organized into a list or matrix). For each combination, predict the associated state and the expected system's behavior.

### Recognition rather than recall

Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.

When designing forms for example, carefully consider whether to provide predefined options for users to choose from or allow free text input. Opt for predefined options when speed and convenience are paramount, and choose free text input for scenarios requiring richer detail or personalized responses. Striking the right balance between convenience and richness of input ensures an optimal user experience.

Provide easily accessible guidance and resources to avoid the need to recall information from memory. Some common mechanisms to implement this effectively in a user interface includes contextual help icons, inline documentation, tooltips, embedded tutorials, on-demand help menus, searchable knowledge bases, and interactive help widgets like AI-enabled resources.

### Flexibility and efficiency of use

Accommodate users of varying levels of expertise by incorporating features such as accelerators and customization options. By doing so, the interface can effectively cater to both novice and expert users, adapting to their respective needs and preferences.

Accelerators — unseen by the novice user — may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.

Customization options allows users to tailor the interface to their preferences helps personalize the overall experience. Providing options for users to rearrange interface elements (e.g. dashboard cards) or create personalized shortcuts for frequently used features enhances their efficiency and comfort in navigating the system. Catering to diverse user needs and preferences fosters a sense of ownership and personal investment or attachment to an experience.

### Aesthetic and minimalist design

Prioritize clear, focused status updates for users to more easily comprehend information at a glance. This reduces cognitive effort and minimizes risk of misinterpretation, frustration, or disengagement.

Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.

### Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors 

Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no code), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

Offer contextual help or guidance to help users resolve issues or understand delays. This facilitates the correct follow-up action required by the user, who may struggle to overcome certain obstacles or comprehend complex tasks if they're only being presented a problem. Propose a clear solution and provide inbuilt functionality to optimize the time to the resolution. 

![Help users recover from errors](./media/usability/h9.svg)

### Help and documentation

Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search for, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.

## Power Platform facilitation

For canvas apps, progress indication and loading can be indicated using the modern [progress bar](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/modern-controls/modern-control-progress-bar) and [spinner](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/modern-controls/modern-control-spinner) controls. The modern [badge](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/modern-controls/modern-controls-badge) is intended to display statuses.

Robust error handling can be implemented in canvas apps on the client [using Power Fx expressions related to errors](/power-platform/power-fx/reference/function-iferror).

Custom server-side errors can be defined with Power Fx using [low code plugins](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/lowcode-plug-ins-examples#input-validation-and-custom-errors), including pre-operation validation.

For model driven apps, usability is built into the interface, so focus the usability heuristics on the parts of the experience you choose to configure. An example of inbuilt accelerator is the [personal views](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/create-edit-views#personal-views) feature, which lets users save filtering and column preferences for a table in an app. [Custom help pages](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/create-custom-help-pages) can be configured to offer a detailed help resource within the app.
