This guide describes the recommendations for improving usability in user interface design. Usability refers to the ease of use and effectiveness of a product for its intended users. Usability directly impacts user satisfaction, errors, and overall interactions with the digital interface, ultimately affecting the overall success of an application.

## Key design strategies

Usability is a quality attribute that assesses how easy user interfaces are to use. The word "usability" also refers to methods for improving ease-of-use during the design process.

Usability is defined by five quality components:

| Component | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Learnability | How easily can tasks be accomplished the first time and how quickly do users learn from their previous experience? |
| Efficiency | Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks? |
| Memorability | When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they reestablish proficiency? |
| Errors | How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they recover from the errors? |
| Satisfaction | How pleasant is it to use the design? |

Consider the following strategies for ensuring usability for your workload.

### Visibility of system status

The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable time.

Use progress indicators or loading animations to reassure users that their request is being processed. These visual indicators prevent frustration from uncertainty and help manage expectations. Without them, users might perceive the system as slow or unresponsive, leading them to abandon the task.

Provide real-time updates to keep users engaged and informed about the outcome of their actions. This prevents confusion or doubt about whether an action was successful or not, potentially resulting in errors or repetitive actions. Use status messages or notifications to clearly communicate successful actions or errors. Overlooking crucial information could lead to errors or misunderstandings.

Incorporate color-coded indicators on different states for quick recognition and understanding of system status. Color is processed faster than text due to its direct neural pathway and evolutionary significance and also evokes emotional associations, further enhancing the user's ability to comprehend information quickly and intuitively. Reading text involves cognitive processing including language comprehension and interpretation. This process requires a longer neural pathway, taking more time and effort compared to the recognition of colors.

Allow users to track progress of ongoing tasks to enhance transparency and empower users to manage their time effectively.

Prioritize accessibility in system status design, as it is critical that users fully understand the experience.

### Reflect the real world

The system should speak the users' language, using words, phrases, and concepts they understand, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions and present information in a natural and logical order.

Use terminology and concepts that are familiar to users and avoid jargon that may alienate them. Users quickly grasp the purpose and functionality of a system when it speaks their language. Aligning system terminology with everyday language helps users feel understood and catered to, enhancing their perception of the app.

Structure system information in a manner that mirrors scenarios and conventions users understand. Providing a familiar layout will help users navigate the interface easily, without spending time deciphering unfamiliar layouts. Present information in a natural and logical sequence that resonates with users' expectations. Emulate familiar real-world processes to facilitate intuitive navigation and interaction within the system to reduce the likelihood of errors or misunderstandings.

:::image type="content" source="media/usability/h2.svg" alt-text="Match the system to the real world.":::

### User control and freedom

Users may inadvertently select system functions and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the undesired state without navigating through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.

Supporting various input methods accommodates users with different preferences and accessibility needs. Offering options like keyboard shortcuts, touch gestures, voice commands, or mouse clicks ensures that users can interact with the interface using their preferred method. Furthermore, allowing users to configure input settings, such as sensitivity or response time, empowers them to fine-tune their interaction experience to match their comfort level and usage patterns. Flexible input methods promote inclusivity and usability, enabling all users to engage with the interface effectively.

Offering granular control over data and privacy settings is crucial for respecting user autonomy and building trust. Adjusting privacy settings, deleting or exporting data, and controlling access permissions for third-party applications ensures users can maintain control over their information. Offering clear explanations and transparent disclosures about data collection practices, security measures, and user rights enables informed decision-making and promotes transparency and accountability.

:::image type="content" source="media/usability/h3.svg" alt-text="Give users control and freedom.":::

### Consistency and standards

Maintain consistency in design to ensure users can easily recognize and understand status indicators, reducing cognitive load and improving usability. Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.

If repeatable experience patterns appear different, users will struggle to interpret the meaning of the variation introduced, leading to inefficiencies in understanding and task completion. Using the matching suite of controls (for example, all modern controls or all legacy) helps ensure visual elements are consistent. Use component libraries or the Power Apps component framework to ensure consistency for more complex or composite repeatable experience patterns.

### Error prevention

Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.

Proactively address potential issues in the interface to maintain workflow continuity. For complex systems, it's beneficial to create a model that outlines the system's dynamics. This model should illustrate the relationships between the system's variables and demonstrate how they change based on different values. Gather values and constraints for each variable (organized into a list or matrix). For each combination, predict the associated state and the expected system's behavior.

:::image type="content" source="media/usability/h5.svg" alt-text="Design ways to prevent errors.":::

### Recognition rather than recall

Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.

When designing forms, for example, carefully consider whether to provide predefined options for users to choose from or allow free text input. Opt for predefined options when speed and convenience are paramount, and choose free text input for scenarios requiring richer detail or personalized responses. Striking the right balance between convenience and richness of input ensures an optimal user experience.

Provide easily accessible guidance and resources to avoid the need to recall information from memory. Some common mechanisms to implement this effectively in a user interface include contextual help icons, inline documentation, tooltips, embedded tutorials, on-demand help menus, searchable knowledge bases, and interactive help widgets like AI-enabled resources.

:::image type="content" source="media/usability/h6.svg" alt-text="Offer recognition patterns instead of asking users to recall.":::

### Flexibility and efficiency of use

Accommodate users of varying levels of expertise by incorporating features such as accelerators and customization options. This approach allows the interface to adapt to the needs and preferences of both novice and expert users effectively.

Accelerators—often unnoticed by novice users—can speed up the interaction for expert user, allowing the system to cater effectively to both the inexperienced and experienced.

Customization options allow users to tailor the interface to their preferences, personalizing the overall experience. By providing options to rearrange interface elements (for example, dashboard cards) or create personalized shortcuts for frequently used features, you enhance user efficiency and comfort in navigating the system. Catering to diverse user needs and preferences fosters a sense of ownership and personal investment or attachment to an experience.

:::image type="content" source="media/usability/h7.svg" alt-text="Offer flexibility for different skill levels.":::

### Aesthetic and minimalist design

Prioritize clear, focused status updates for users to more easily comprehend information at a glance. This approach reduces cognitive effort and minimizes risk of misinterpretation, frustration, or disengagement.

Dialogues should not contain irrelevant or rarely needed information. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.

:::image type="content" source="media/usability/h8.svg" alt-text="Apply simplicity in design.":::

### Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors

Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no code), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

Provide contextual help or guidance to assist users in resolving issues or understanding delays. This approach helps users determine the appropriate next steps, especially when facing obstacles or complex tasks. Instead of merely presenting a problem, offer a clear solution and incorporate built-in functionality to expedite resolution.

:::image type="content" source="media/usability/h9.svg" alt-text="Help users recover from errors.":::

### Help and documentation

While the system should be intuitive enough to use without documentation, there may be instances where help and documentation are necessary. In such cases, ensure that the information is easy to find, task-oriented, concise, and provides clear step-by-step instructions.

## Power Platform facilitation

For canvas apps, you can indicate progress and loading states with the [progress bar](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/modern-controls/modern-control-progress-bar) and [spinner](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/modern-controls/modern-control-spinner) modern controls. Use the [badge control](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/modern-controls/modern-controls-badge) to display status information.

Implement robust error handling in canvas apps on the client [using Power Fx expressions related to errors](/power-platform/power-fx/reference/function-iferror). Define custom server-side errors with Power Fx using [low-code plugins](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/lowcode-plug-ins-examples#input-validation-and-custom-errors), which include pre-operation validation.

In model-driven apps, where usability is built into the interface, focus on configuring aspects of the experience that enhance usability. An example of a built-in accelerator is the [personal views](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/create-edit-views#personal-views) feature, which lets users save filtering and column preferences for a table in an app. Additionally, configure [custom help pages](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/create-custom-help-pages) to offer a detailed help resource within the app.
