# Experience Optimization tradeoffs

During the design phase of a workload, it's important to consider how decisions based on the [Experience Optimization design principles](./principles.md) and recommendations in the [Design review checklist for Experience Optimization](./checklist.md) might influence the goals and optimization efforts of other pillars. Certain decisions may benefit some pillars, while being tradeoffs for others. This article lists example tradeoffs that a workload team might encounter when designing workload architecture and operations for experience optimzation.
