# Recommendations for optimizing user perception and aesthetics

This guide provides an overview of universal visual design patterns that affect user perception and ultimately influence satisfaction. Visual elements in design serve as the foundational building blocks used to create compelling visual compositions. These elements collectively influence user perception in various ways.

## Key design strategies

There has been a lot of research on human perception of visual design. Users don’t look at the visual elements in silos. Instead, they perceive them as relations to other elements and the context in which they are viewed. These relationships affect the user’s perception. They can attract attention to specific areas, evoke emotions, aid comprehension, enhance aesthetics, and reinforce brand identity. Thoughtful choices and arrangements of visual elements create engaging, memorable, and effective user experiences that resonate with their target audience.

### Balance and weight

A composition is balanced when all the elements are in optical equilibrium. Oftentimes, the mathematical placement needs to be optically adjusted. Some of the elements that affect the visual weight are size, color, density, white space.

### Proximity

Items that are closer together appear to be more related. When spacing elements ensure that there is a noticeable distinction in spacing between elements that should be more related versus less so.

### Continuity

Elements that are arranged on a line or a curve are perceived to be more related than elements not on a line or a curve.

### Closure

Human brain strives for simplicity and recognizes a single pattern rather than individual objects even if there is missing information.

### Focal point

It is an element that stands out and grabs the attention first. Ideally, design is made of consecutive focal points (ideally in the number of between one to three) from strongest to weakest that guide users throughout the content.

### Similarity

Objects that look similar will be recognized as a pattern or a group. They will be expected to have the same functionality.

### Figure and ground

People instinctively perceive elements to be either a “figure” (what stands out in the front) or a “ground” (what recedes into the back). Hence, context influences the perception and needs to ensure that there is enough delineation to distinguish between background and the elements that are important. White and negative space increases comprehension of content.

### Grouping

Elements tend to be perceived as groups if they are sharing an area with a clearly defined boundary.

### Signals vs noise

Visual elements such as lines, contrast, spacing, etc. are used to inform users that something is important, in which case they are signals. However, too many signals, or signals highlighting information that is not important become noise.

### The Aesthetic-Usability Effect

It takes about 50 milliseconds for users to form an opinion about an application. This first impression depends on many factors: structure, colors, spacing, symmetry, amount of text, fonts, and more. A positive first impression can increase overall satisfaction. Research has shown that users are more tolerant of minor usability issues when they find an interface visually appealing. Additionally, quality of design is an indicator of credibility.

## Power Platform facilitation

These visual design recommendations are universal for overall design, and implicit in the Power Apps modern controls. Take these into consideration when determining overall design and arrangement of components available.
