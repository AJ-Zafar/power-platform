# Operational Excellence tradeoffs

During the design phase of a workload, it's important to consider how decisions based on the [Operational Excellence design principles](./principles.md) and recommendations in the [Design review checklist for Operational Excellence](./checklist.md) might influence the goals and optimization efforts of other pillars. Certain decisions may benefit some pillars, while being tradeoffs for others. This article lists example tradeoffs that a workload team might encounter when designing workload architecture and operations for ooperational excellence.
