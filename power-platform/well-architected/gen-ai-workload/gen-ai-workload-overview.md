# Overview of Generative AI Power Platform workloads

This article provides Well-Architected Framework best practices for a Generative AI Power Platform workload. Application owners, Power Platform administrators, business stakeholders, and architects can use this guidance to create a technical foundation for their Generative AI Power Platform workload.

>[!TIP]
>To assess your workload through the lenses of reliability, security, operational excellence, performance efficiency, and experience optimization see the [Power Platform Well-Architected Assessment](https://aka.ms/powa/assessment).

## What is a Gen AI workload?

The term _workload_ is used to describe a set of application resources, data, and supporting infrastructure that work together to deliver desired business outcomes. A workload comprises application and technology components as well as behavioral, development, and operational processes.

Generative AI is an artificial intelligence technology that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate original content and provide natural language understanding and responses. For details, see Technology guidance > [Generative AI](/ai/playbook/technology-guidance/generative-ai/).

A Generative AI Power Platform workload leverages the capabilities of Microsoftâ€™s Power Platform to integrate and utilize generative AI models for automating and enhancing business processes.

## What are the common challenges?

Developing Power Platform workloads that use Generative AI features can be complex and presents several challenges. Here are some of the most common ones:

- **Data quality and availability**: Generative AI models require large volumes of high-quality data. Ensuring data is clean, well-structured, and accessible can increase complexity.
- **Integration with existing systems**: Seamlessly integrating generative AI with existing IT infrastructure and business processes can be resource-intensive and technically challenging.
- **Ethical and compliance issues**: Addressing ethical concerns and ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory standards is crucial. This includes managing data privacy, avoiding biases in AI models, and maintaining transparency.
- **Skills and expertise**: Developing and managing generative AI solutions requires specialized skills. Organizations often need to invest in training their workforce or hiring new talent with the necessary expertise.
- **Cultural resistance and change management**: Employees may resist adopting new AI technologies due to fears of job displacement or changes in established workflows. Effective change management strategies are essential to ease this transition.
- **Cost and resource allocation**: Implementing generative AI can be costly. Organizations need to carefully manage their resources and often start with small, high-impact pilot projects to demonstrate value before scaling up.
- **Security concerns**: Ensuring the security of AI systems and protecting sensitive data from breaches is a critical challenge. This includes safeguarding against potential vulnerabilities in AI models and infrastructure.
- **User Interface design**: Creating intuitive and user-friendly interfaces that effectively leverage AI capabilities without overwhelming users can be difficult.

Addressing these challenges requires thorough planning, collaboration across different teams, and a strategic approach to integrating AI into business processes.
