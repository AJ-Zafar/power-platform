# Design Principles of intelligent application workloads

Guidance about well-architected intelligent application workloads is built on the Power Platform Well-Architected Framework and its five pillars of architectural excellence. The following table lists each pillar and a summary of its goals.

| Well-Architected Framework pillar | Summary |
|---|-----|
| **Reliability** |	An intelligent application workload requires resiliency at the architecture layer to ensure the AI models and workflows are highly available and can recover quickly from failures. This involves building redundancy and implementing robust error-handling mechanisms. Resiliency at the architecture layer also maintains the integrity of data used by AI models to ensure consistent and accurate outputs. |
| **Security** | An intelligent application workload might handle sensitive data. Safeguard sensitive data used and generated by AI models. Implement encryption, access controls, and regular security audits. Ensure the workload complies with relevant regulation standards, such as GDPR or HIPAA, to protect user privacy and data. |
| **Performance Efficiency** | An intelligent application workload needs to be designed to scale seamlessly with increasing data volumes and user demands. You must also manage costs.   |
| **Operational Excellence** | An intelligent application workload requires comprehensive monitoring and logging to track the performance and health of AI models, workflows and conversations. This helps in quickly identifying and resolving issues. Operational Excellence also recommends how to use automation to streamline operations, reduce manual intervention, and minimize the risk of human error. Ensure that your intelligent application workload meets operational excellence standards. |
| **Experience Optimization** | An intelligent application workload needs to have a focus on conversation design to be user-friendly and allow users to achieve their goals with minimal effort. The experience should account for topics the generative AI can't handle and have fallback mechanisms in place. Also implement mechanisms to gather user feedback and continuously improve the AI models and workload based on this feedback. |
