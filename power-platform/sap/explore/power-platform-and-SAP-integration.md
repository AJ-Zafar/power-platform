Our SAP connectors support all SAP versions from R/3 (early 1990s) forward, including SAP ECC and SAP S4/HANA as well as all products across the SAP portfolio that support the [OData Version 4.01 Protocol](https://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.01/odata-v4.01-part1-protocol.html).

Users of Power Platform apps integrated with SAP will need the following licenses:

- A Power Apps Premium license
- An SAP indirect-named user license

If you already have SAP direct named user licenses, you can use these licenses with Power Apps. It is worth noting, however, that SAP indirect named user licenses cost less than direct named user licenses. Customers can also use [Digital Access Licenses](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/999033817c60412f88303c6d6a80c348/4786b16cae0047279eac879b7701d044.html?version=2021.001&locale=en-US).

Enterprise templates for Power Platform include the [SAP Procurement](../../enterprise-templates/finance/sap-procurement/overview.md) and [SAP Supplier Self Service](../../enterprise-templates/finance/sap-supplier-self-service/overview.md) templates. These templates and ready-to-use copilots that include sample components and cloud flows for common SAP business processes can accelerate your Power Platform and SAP integration journey.
