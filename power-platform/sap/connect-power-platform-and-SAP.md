# Connect Power Platform and SAP

With our powerful connectors, you can easily access and manipulate SAP data, enabling you to create custom applications, automate workflows, and generate insightful reports.

The [SAP ERP Connector](/connectors/saperp/) utilizes SAP NetWeaver Gateway APIs to connect to your SAP environment for create, read, and update operations on SAP data. It can also be used to call RFCs and BAPIs.

The [SAP OData Connector](/connectors/sapodata/) can consume data from across the SAP product portfolio using the OData service.

Both connectors utilize the Microsoft On-premise data gateway for SAP connections, supporting data encryption in motion for both connectors.
