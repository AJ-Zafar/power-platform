# Building integrated Power Platform Applications for SAP Consultants

SAP Consultants can leverage Microsoft Power Platform to build applications that seamlessly integrate with SAP systems. This integration enables the creation of copilots, apps, workflows, and websites that enhance business processes by utilizing SAP data.

## Microsoft Power Platform Connectors

Microsoft Power Platform provides several [connectors to integrate with SAP systems](/power-platform/sap/connect-power-platform-and-SAP), including the SAP ERP Connector and the SAP OData Connector. These connectors encapsulate the necessary APIs for data exchange between Power Platform and SAP, supporting both RFC-based and HTTP-based connectivity. The connectors enable app makers to perform operations such as creating, updating, or retrieving data from SAP, making it easier to build integrated solutions.

## Capabilities of Power Platform Low Code Tools

- **Power Apps:** Power Apps is a visual development tool that allows users to build custom applications with little to no code. It connects to various data sources, including SAP, and runs on any device. Power Apps can be used to create forms, dashboards, and interactive applications that streamline business processes.
- **Power Automate (Cloud Flows):** Power Automate is a cloud-based automation platform that enables users to create workflows that automate repetitive tasks. It provides powerful AI, RPA, and process mining capabilities. With Power Automate, users can create flows that interact with SAP data, automate data entry, and trigger actions based on specific events.
- **Copilot Studio:** Copilot Studio allows developers to create and customize AI-powered conversational chatbots (Copilots) for internal or external use. These chatbots can be integrated with SAP to provide users with a conversational interface for querying data, performing transactions, and receiving notifications.
- **Power Pages:** Power Pages enables organizations to quickly design, configure, and publish secure, data-driven enterprise-grade websites. These websites can be integrated with SAP to provide users with access to SAP data and services through a web interface.
## Templates for Quick Start

 Microsoft provides a variety of [templates](/power-platform/enterprise-templates/finance/sap-procurement/administer/get-started) to help users get started quickly with building SAP-integrated solutions on Power Platform. These templates serve as starting points for specific use cases and outcomes, providing essential techniques, building blocks, and sample apps and flows. These templates can be customized to fit specific business needs and accelerate the development process.

## Example Workflow structure

- **Trigger:** A Power App triggers a Power Automate flow to create a sales order in SAP.
- **Construct JSON:** The flow constructs a JSON payload with the sales order details.
- **Call BAPI:** The flow calls the BAPI BAPI_SALESORDER_CREATEFROMDAT2 using the SAP ERP Connector.
- **Parse** Response: The flow parses the JSON response to extract the sales order number.
- **Update App:** The Power App is updated with the sales order number for user reference.

## App-builing tips
### Using Power Automate Flows with Other Applications

Power Automate flows that integrate with SAP can be triggered by custom applications or any software capable of REST integration.

### Error Handling

Errors in SAP are displayed to users in Power Apps similarly to SAP, with red text detailing the error. Users can correct data-related errors in Power Apps and resubmit their work to SAP.

### Handling File Attachments

Power Automate can attach files to objects in SAP using Generic Object Services (GOS) and/or ArchiveLink based on your requirements.

### Adding Custom Fields to Power Apps
Adding custom fields to a Power App is straightforward. Fields can be inserted and copy-pasted in the WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor6.

### Calling Custom Function Modules

The Power Platform can call custom function modules if they are remote-enabled. However, SAP will not support custom function modules if they do not work correctly, as they are considered custom code7.

### Handling Completely Custom Processes in SAP

Custom database tables can be read using the "Read SAP Table with Parsing" action for all read operations. For create and update operations, remote-enable the custom function modules used to maintain this data. Once remote-enabled, these function modules can be called by the SAP connector8.

### User Requirements for Power Apps

No installation is required on users' PCs. All Power Apps are accessed through a web browser9.

### Deployment Time for Power Apps on SAP

Prebuilt Power Apps on SAP can transact against your SAP system immediately. However, you may need to modify these app templates by adding custom fields or SAP-standard fields not included in the template. Typically, you can have something ready for business users to test within a few weeks.

### Building Mobile Power Apps on SAP

Power Apps is responsive to mobile devices, and native apps can also be built on the Power Platform11.

### Coexistence of Fiori Apps and Power Apps

Fiori Apps can be embedded in Power Apps menus, and Power Apps can also be embedded in the Fiori launchpad12.


### Upgrading from SAP ECC to S4/HANA

Upgrading from SAP ECC to S4/HANA should not break integrations. Core data models may change, but prebuilt Power Automate flows account for these changes. SAP ensures their published APIs are carried over to new versions.
