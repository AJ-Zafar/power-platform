To provide this service, the App processes and stores information, such as user's credentials and the data the user processes in [!include[](../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics.md)] CRM or [!include[](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)]. The App is provided for use only by end users of Microsoft customers who are authorized users of [!include[](../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics.md)] CRM or [!include[](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)]. The App processes user's information for the Microsoft customer, and Microsoft may reveal information processed by the App for the organization that provides users access to [!include[](../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics.md)] CRM or [!include[](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)]. Microsoft doesn't use information users process via the App for any other purpose.  

If customers use the App to connect to [!include[](../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics.md)] CRM (online) or [!include[](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)], by installing the App, users consent to transmission of their organization's assigned ID, assigned end user ID, and device ID to Microsoft. This is for purposes of enabling connections across multiple devices, or improving [!include[](../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics.md)] CRM (online), [!include[](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] or the App.  

**Location data.** If users enable location-based services or features in the App, the App may collect and use precise location data. This data can be Global Position System (GPS) data and data identifying nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi hotspots. The App may send location data to [!include[](../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics.md)] CRM or [!include[](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)]. The App may send the location data to [!include[](../includes/pn-bing-maps.md)] and other third party mapping services, such as Google Maps and [!include[](../includes/tn-apple.md)] Maps, a user named in the user's phone to process the user's location data within the App. Users may disable location-based services or features or disable the App's access to user's location by turning off either the location service or the App's access to the location service.
