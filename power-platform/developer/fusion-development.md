Fusion development allows your business to build better applications, faster by bringing together professional developers with citizen, or low-code, developers.

## Personas for fusion development

Bellow you can find the personas and the definition in a fusion team:

| Persona | Description |
| ---- | ---- | 
| **Citizen Developer** or maker | A business user with business knowledge looking for ways to improve a business process. Use visual, drag and drop and low code tools. Usually don't have a technical background. |
| **Professional Developer** or code-first developer | Pro devs use pro dev tools to accomplish pro dev tasks. For example, white code in VS or VS Code using pro languages like C#. |
| **IT Professional** or DevOps Engineer | An IT professional responsible for the Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) of business applications. |

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Weâ€™re not trying to make citizen developer into pro devs, or vice versa. We are focused on helping them build together doing what they are best at doing.

Empowering the citizen developer can enable the pro developers to focus on specialized problems, avoiding simple and repetitive tasks that can be performed by the citizen developer himself.

## Collaboration

The Power Platform is designed to empower fusion teams allowing three key audiences to come together.

> [!TIP]
> Citizen maker and pro-dev tools should integrate smoothly to enable both communities to work together effectively.

The role of the professional developer and IT Professional is to create a safe environment where citizen developer can be empowered to achieve more with minimum friction.

> [!NOTE]
> Everyone should use citizen maker tools to accomplish citizen maker tasks. For example, pro devs use same visual tooling as citizen makers when creating apps on Power Platform
