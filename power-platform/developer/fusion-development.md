# Fusion development overview

Fusion development or fusion teams development, is defined by Gartner as "distributed and multidisciplinary digital business teams that blend technology and other types of domain expertise." (Source: 2019 Gartner Digital Business Teams Survey)

Fusion development allows your business to build better applications, faster by bringing together professional developers with citizen, or low-code, developers.

## Personas for fusion development

Apps created with Power Apps are consumed by users using their desktop or mobile devices. There are different types of Power Apps: canvas, model-driven, and portal.

| Persona | Description |
| ---- | ---- | 
| **Citizen Developer** or maker | A business user with business knowledge looking for ways to improve a business process. Use visual, drag and drop and low code tools. Usually don't have a technical background. |
| **Professional Developer** or code-first developer | Pro devs use pro dev tools to accomplish pro dev tasks. For example, white code in VS or VS Code using pro languages like C#. |
| **IT Professional** or DevOps Engineer | An IT professional responsible for the Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) of business applications. |

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Weâ€™re not trying to make citizen makers into pro devs, or vice versa. We are focused on helping them build together doing what they are best at doing.

## Collaboration

The Power Platform is designed to empower fusion teams allowing three key audiences to come together.

The role of the professional developer and IT Professional is to create a safe environment where citizen developer can be empowered to achieve more with minimum friction.

> [!TIP]
> Citizen maker and pro-dev tools should integrate smoothly to enable both communities to work together effectively.

> [!NOTE]
> Everyone should use citizen maker tools to accomplish citizen maker tasks. For example, pro devs use same visual tooling as citizen makers when creating apps on Power Platform
