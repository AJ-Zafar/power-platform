# Create a Canvas App front end for your ASP.NET web API (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Power Platform enables web API developers to quickly build mobile or web applications using a Power Apps canvas app as a front end. With the Power Platform connected service in Visual Studio 2022, ASP.NET web API developers can easily create a custom connector you can use with Power Apps and Power Automate.

You can start creating a canvas app before publishing your API to a public endpoint using Visual Studio [*dev tunnels*](/aspnet/core/test/dev-tunnels#create-a-tunnel). Dev tunnels enable an ad-hoc connection between your web API running locally and your Power Apps. This feature can be used, to locally debug and test your web API in the context of the Microsoft Power Platform in real time (inner loop).

This tutorial uses the sample ASP.NET Weather web API to create a custom connector that you can use with a canvas app. [More info](/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?tabs=visual-studio)

## Prerequisites

- Download [Visual Studio 2022 version 17.6 Preview 2](/visualstudio/releases/2022/release-notes-preview) with the **ASP.NET and web development**  workload installed. You need to be signed in to Visual Studio to create and use dev tunnels. The feature isn't available in Visual Studio for Mac.
- A Power Platform environment with permission to create custom connectors.

>[!NOTE]
>
> If you need help getting started with Microsoft Power Platform, go to [Create a developer environment](create-developer-environment.md).

## Step 1: Create a new ASP.NET project in Visual Studio

1. Create a new **ASP.NET Core Web API** project, and then select **Next**.
1. Type `WeatherSample` into **Project name**, and then select **Next**.
1. Select **Create**.

Step 1 created a solution named `WeatherSample` with a `WeatherSample` project. This project contains an example controller for a RESTful HTTP service.

## Step 2: Add Power Platform as a connected service

:::image type="content" source="media/vs-step2-1.png" alt-text="Add service dependency":::

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **Connected Services** node and select **Manage Connected Services** from the context menu.
1. In the **Connected Services** tab, select the **+** icon for **Service Dependencies**.
1. On the **Add dependency** dialog, type `Power Platform` into the search box.
1. Select **Microsoft Power Platform**, and then select **Next**.
1. If you aren't signed in already, sign into your Microsoft Power Platform account. If you don't have a Power Platform account, [Create a Developer Environment](create-developer-environment.md).
1. In the **Connect to Microsoft Power Platform** screen: select your developer environment.
1. In **Custom connectors name**, the value `WeatherSample_Connector` should already be set.
1. In **Select a public dev tunnel**, select the **+** icon.
   
   1. In the field **Name**, type `SampleTunnel`.
   1. Select **Tunnel Type**: **Persistent**.
   <!-- I don't see the option to select Tunnel Type or Access after upgrading to VS 2022 v17.5.3 I don't have the preview version installed  -->
   1. Select **Access** : **public**.
   1. Select **OK**.
   
1. Select **Finish**
1. Once the connected service is configured, select **Close**.

## Step 3: Create a canvas app with the custom connector

When a tunnel is active and Visual Studio runs a web app, the web browser opens to a tunnel URL instead of a localhost URL. With your Visual Studio Solution running:

1. In Visual Studio, start debugging. You can press **F5** or your preferred method.
1. The browser opens. You'll see a warning page on the first request sent to the tunnel URL. Select **Continue**.
1. With the web API running, in a new browser, open [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com). Select your developer environment in the top right corner.
1. [Create a blank canvas app](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/create-blank-app). Select **Phone** as the format.
1. In the top menu, select **Add data**.
1. Type `WeatherSample` in the search box. Select the **WeatherSample_Connector**, and select **Connect**. More information: [Add connections to your canvas app](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/add-data-connection)
<!-- Above didn't work for me with VS 2022 v17.5.3. I don't have the preview version installed -->
1. In the menu, select **Insert** > **Button**. Drag and drop the button to the bottom of the form. Change the **Text** to **Load Data**.
1. Add the following formula to the **OnSelect** property:
   
   ```powerapps-dot
   ClearCollect(weatherCollection, WeatherSample_Connector.GetWeatherForecast())
   ```
   
1. In the menu, select [Insert Vertical Gallery](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/add-gallery). Select the **weatherCollection** as the data source. Change the layout to title and subtitle.
1. Run the app. You should see the result as shown at the top this article.

## Step 4: Debug your API

With your power app running you can set a breakpoint, and debug your Power Apps app or Power Automate flow. You can also use [Hot Reload](/visualstudio/debugger/hot-reload)
