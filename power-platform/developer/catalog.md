# Catalog components and templates

Organizations where Developers & Makers build and share components and templates get more value from the Power Platform. Just building is not enough. Sharing power platform artifacts at scale fosters communities and support groups to emerge, incubate and unlock value from diverse set of personnel in an organization.

Successful organizations adopt a *fusion teams* model whereby pro-developers, makers and admins all work together to help their fellow employees derive the highest value possible from the Power Platform.

The catalog in Power Platform enables developers and makers to:

- Crowd-source and find Power Platform templates and code components within their organization easily
- Find and install the latest and authoritative version of a Custom Connector, PCF control, or App & Flow templates among the sprawl of such components built and distributed across many environments
- Get started with templates that provide immediate value including those that connect to their enterprise systems & resources, and utilize organization's themes

For admins and line of business approvers, the catalog:

- Provides a central location, a *single source of truth*, to store and maintain power platform artifacts they can curate and control to accelerate value for Makers and Developers
- Enables approval workflows to enable usage of sanctioned components and templates where a high degree of care is required due to sensitive regulatory and statutory scenarios
- Provides management capabilities with settings and metadata

## Terminology

These terms are important to understand when using the catalog:


|Term|Description|
|---------|---------|
|**Catalog Item**|The unit of interaction with the catalog is called an item. <br /><br /> - What is being submitted to or installed from the catalog. <br /><br /> - Typically, this will be a Dataverse solution or package deployer package. This can contain a fully built application or a template for a power app or flow or power platform code-first component such as a custom connector, PCF control. |
|**Catalog Publisher**|The owning entity of the Application. For example, this can be the human resources IT team or another Line of Business team.<br /><br /> - Comprises of a group of people in an organization that are responsible for managing it's lifecycle. <br /><br /> - Support and engineering contacts can be provided.<br /><br />| - Not to be confused with the Solution Publisher
|**Submission** |The act of sharing an item involves submitting it to the catalog. This creates a *submission request* in the system.|
|**Submission Request**|The result of a submission. This can be approved or declined. If auto-approval is configured for the catalog no approval is required.|
|**Discovery**|Act of finding items within a catalog by authorized users.|
|**Acquisition**|Act of installing the item to a target environment by a developer.|
