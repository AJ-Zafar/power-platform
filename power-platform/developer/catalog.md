# Catalog components and templates

Organizations where Developers & Makers build and share components and templates get more value from the Power Platform. Just building is not enough. Sharing power platform artifacts at scale fosters communities and support groups to emerge, incubate and unlock value from diverse set of personnel in an organization.

Successful organizations adopt a *fusion teams* model whereby pro-developers, makers and admins all work together to help their fellow employees derive the highest value possible from the Power Platform.

The catalog in Power Platform enables developers and makers to:

- Crowd-source and find Power Platform templates and code components within their organization easily
- Find and install the latest and authoritative version of a Custom Connector, PCF control, or App & Flow templates among the sprawl of such components built and distributed across many environments
- Get started with templates that provide immediate value including those that connect to their enterprise systems & resources, and utilize organization's themes

For admins and line of business approvers, the catalog:

- Provides a central location, a *single source of truth*, to store and maintain power platform artifacts they can curate and control to accelerate value for Makers and Developers
- Enables approval workflows to enable usage of sanctioned components and templates where a high degree of care is required due to sensitive regulatory and statutory scenarios
- Provides management capabilities with settings and metadata

## Catalog process

<!-- Need to extract these points from the diagram somehow -->

### Create

### Submit

### Approve and Store

### Discover

### Acquire

## Terminology

These terms are important to understand when using the catalog:


|Term|Description|
|---------|---------|
|**Catalog Item**|The unit of interaction with the catalog is called an item. <br /><br /> - What is being submitted to or installed from the catalog. <br /><br /> - Typically, this will be a Dataverse solution or package deployer package. This can contain a fully built application or a template for a power app or flow or power platform code-first component such as a custom connector, PCF control. |
|**Catalog Publisher**|The owning entity of the Application. For example, this can be the human resources IT team or another Line of Business team.<br /><br /> - Comprises of a group of people in an organization that are responsible for managing it's lifecycle. <br /><br /> - Support and engineering contacts can be provided.<br /><br /> - Not to be confused with the Solution Publisher|
|**Submission** |The act of sharing an item involves submitting it to the catalog. This creates a *submission request* in the system.|
|**Submission Request**|The result of a submission. This can be approved or declined. If auto-approval is configured for the catalog no approval is required.|
|**Discovery**|Act of finding items within a catalog by authorized users.|
|**Acquisition**|Act of installing the item to a target environment by a developer.|

## Get started

To get started you need to complete the following:

1. [Install the Catalog Manager application](#install-the-catalog-manager-application)
1. [Configure the catalog](#configure-the-catalog): Configure catalog settings including metadata management and enabling auto-approvals
1. [Administer the catalog](#administer-the-catalog): Perform ongoing catalog administration including Approving new submissions, reviewing submission and install failures

## Install the Catalog Manager application

To start using the catalog, you need to install the **Catalog Manager**application from AppSource.

> [!NOTE]
> Most organizations will only need to install one catalog. While multiple catalogs within a tenant are supported they are for advanced departmental, data residency type scenarios and need to be evaluated in light of your business needs.

### Prerequisites

You must have the following security role assignment and your Dataverse environment must be above the minimum version.

- Security role: You must have the System administrator security role on the environment.
- A Dataverse environment with minimum DB version of `9.2.22122.00148`. You can check the Database version:

   - In the **Admin Center** > **Environment page** > **Version card**.
   - By using the [RetrieveVersion function](xref:Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.RetrieveVersion) with your browser. Type <br />`https://<your org>.<your region code>.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.2/RetrieveVersion`<br /> in your browser address bar  and view the JSON returned.

### Installation instructions

Here are instructions to install the catalog:

1. Login into [appsource.microsoft.com](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) with your tenant credentials.

## Configure the catalog

After you have installed the Catalog Manager application, in [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/) locate the application and click **Play** to open the application.

### Configure catalog metadata

1. In the navigation pane, in the **Configuration** group at the bottom, select **Catalog Configuration**.
1. Select **Default Catalog Name** to open the **Catalog Configuration** form.

Here you can set the following configuration values which are particularly important when you have more than one catalog.

|Field  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Catalog Name**|Type a descriptive name for the catalog.|
|**Description**|Type a brief description of the catalog.|
|**Help Link**|Type a URL to a resource for your organization that contains your documentation about using the catalog.|
|**Image**|Upload an image to easily identify the catalog.|

In the **Catalog Configuration** card on the right side, there are two choices you can apply

#### Enable Auto Approval

This is the setting for the entire catalog.

Organizations can take a stance of approved by default or impose an approval process for submissions.

Auto-approval can be enabled at two levels:

- **Catalog as a whole** â€“ This setting. This is to enable the scenario where every submission is auto-approved regardless of publisher.  
- **Publisher** : Navigate to **Catalog Publishers** in Catalog Manager App and turn on for individual Catalog publishers. Use this when there is a trusted group for which no approval is required.

If you choose to enable auto approval for the entire catalog, settings at the publisher level will not apply.

Even with auto-approval, submission requests that get auto-approved can are available to be viewed within the Catalog Manager app. They can be viewed under **Requests** using the **All Approval Request**view. More information: [Approve & Reject submission requests](#approve--reject-submission-requests)


#### Enable Unmanaged Solutions

This setting is enabled by default. You must enable this setting if you want to use the deployment mode of **Template**. More information: TODO x-ref Submission >Deployment 

You can choose to allow disallow sharing of unmanaged solutions via the catalog. 
<!-- Why would someone want to do this? -->

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

The following are frequently asked questions related to catalog in Power Platform.

### When would I need to create more than one catalogs?

While most organizations are likely to leverage just one catalog, it is possible to create more than one catalogs for distinct audiences. These include segregation of data concerns from a geography, departmental, business group (subsidiary) or other reasons.

### Is there a license required to use the Catalog?

For the public preview, the catalog feature is available to be used without any licensing. For GA, the catalog feature will require the catalog to be setup in a managed environment.
