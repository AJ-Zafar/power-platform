# pac pipeline

Pipelines in Power Platform aim to democratize application lifecycle management (ALM) for Power Platform and Dynamics 365 customers by bringing ALM automation and continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) capabilities into the service in a manner that's more approachable for all makers, admins, and developers.

:::image type="content" source="power-platform/alm/media/deployment-pipelines.png" alt-text="Example of the deployment Pipelines feature":::

Pipelines significantly reduce the effort and domain knowledge previously required to realize the ROI from adopting healthy, automated ALM processes within your team or organization.

- Admins easily configure automated deployment pipelines in minutes rather than days or weeks.
- Makers have an intuitive user experience for easily deploying their solutions.
