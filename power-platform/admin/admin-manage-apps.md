# Manage Power Apps
If you're an Environment Admin, Global admin, or Power Platform admin, you can manage the apps created in your organization.

Admins can do the following from the Power Apps Admin center:
* Add or change the users with whom an app is shared
* Delete apps not currently in use
* View the data sources used by an app

## Prerequisites
* Either a Power Apps plan or Power Automate plan. Alternatively, you can sign up for a [free Power Apps trial](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/signup-for-powerapps).
* Power Apps Environment Admin, Global admin, or Power Platform service admin permissions. For more information, see [Environments administration in Power Apps](environments-administration.md).

## Manage an app
1. Sign in to the Admin center at [https://admin.powerapps.com](https://admin.powerapps.com).
2. In the navigation pane, click or tap **Environments**, and then click or tap the environment that contains the app that you want to manage.

    If you don't see **Environments** in the navigation pane, that indicates you don't have a Power Apps plan, a Power Automate plan, or a Power Apps trial license.

3. On the **Resources** tab, click or tap **Apps**, and then click or tap the app that you want to manage.

    This takes you to the app **Details** page.

    * Click or tap the trash can icon to delete the app.
    * View data connections, flows, and other details associated with the app.
    * Click or tap **Share** to view or modify the users with whom the app is shared.
