# Dynamics 365 US Government - Feature availability 

Microsoft strives to maintain functional parity between our commercially available service and those enabled though our U.S. Government clouds. These services are referred to as Dynamics 365 Government Community Cloud (GCC) and GCC High. Refer to the [Global Geographic Availability](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/geographic-availability/) tool to see where the Dynamics 365 Apps and Offers are available throughout the world, including approximate availability timelines. 

There are exceptions to the principle of maintaining Product functional parity within the U.S. Government clouds. For more information, see the following download: [Business Applications US Government](https://aka.ms/BAPFunctionalParity).
