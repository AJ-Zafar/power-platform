# Tenant to tenant migration

## Move an environment to a different tenant

You can use the tenant-to-tenant migration feature to request to have an environment in one tenant moved to another tenant. This feature enables customers to support the following cases:

- Consolidate multiple tenants  nder one tenant
- Support acquisition from Company A to Company B

You need toÂ [submit a support request](get-help-support) to initiate tenant-to-tenant migration.

There are no user-interface changes or version changes as part of this move. You can move one or multiple environments. Once complete, your environment(s) will appear in your new tenant.

### Prerequisite:

- Destination tenant has enough user licenses
- Destination tenant has enough environment licenses
- Destination tenant has valid paid subscription
- Destination tenant has enough storage for environments being migrated

If you do not have a paid subscription in the destination tenant, then you'll need to create one. You might need to purchase a new subscription in the destination tenant (or convert a trial to paid), if not already done.

Depending on how many source environments you are migrating, you'll need to create a temporary environment or environments in the destination tenant. The source environment type and destination environment type must match (production vs non-production (sandbox)). The users to be migrated from one tenant to another need to be created on the target tenant as well.

The destination tenant needs an equal or higher number of active user licenses, environment licenses for the environments being migrated, and equal or greater storage as the source tenant.

In order to perform this operation, you'll need to provide some information, such as:

- What is the source tenant domain and its region? (example: EMEA, NA, APAC)
- What is the destination tenant domain and its region? (example: EMEA, NA, APAC)
- Does the destination tenant have a valid subscription?
- Does the destination tenant have enough available user licenses?
- Does the destination tenant have enough environment licenses?
- Does the destination tenant have enough storage available for the environments being migrated?

## Post Migration

After moving environments to another tenant:

- The environment ID in the target tenant cannot be set to the same environment ID as in the source tenant. This is not supported.
- The org URL, org ID, and the name do not change.
- The source environment will not be accessible.
- Security group mapping is handled as part of the manual tenant-to-tenant migration process. At the very least, a replacement (or removal) will be needed because the security group won't exist with the same ID in the new Azure AD tenant.
