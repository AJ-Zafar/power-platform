# Configure default sync filters for appointments, contacts, and tasks

Server-side synchronization uses filter criteria thatâ€™s set in synchronization filters to determine which app rows are synchronized with Exchange for each user. Sync filters are first initialized for a user when server-side synchronization is configured by a user for rows such as appointments, contacts, and tasks. For more information, see Create or modify online synchronization filters.
