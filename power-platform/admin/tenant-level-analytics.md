## Download Reports

Select **Download** to view available downloads and then select any of the reports to download them into Microsoft Excel.

All the download reports, except "Active Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Plan Users by Application", show data:   
- for an environment <br />
  and <br />
- per the timeline in the filters for the out-of-box Dataverse analytics reports. If you select a certain date range for the out-of-box Dataverse reports, the same time filter applies to the downloads.  
- The maximum duration for data availability is 30 days.

The "Active Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Plan Users by Application" report always shows the last 30 days of data at the tenant level.
