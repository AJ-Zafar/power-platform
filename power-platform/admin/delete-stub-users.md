# Delete stub users from an environment (Preview)
Stub user records are created as placeholder records in the user table. The records are typically imported from external systems during migration of those applications. The stub user records are created with a disabled status and assigned with a security role. These users canâ€™t log into the Dataverse environment. For more information, see [how stub users are created](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/create-users#how-stub-users-are-created).

The stub users who are still active in the Microsoft Entra ID can be converted and activated as Dataverse users by mapping the stub users to the Microsoft Entra ID user. For stub users who are no longer in Microsoft Entra ID, they remain in disabled status. These disabled status stub [users can be deleted.](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/delete-users#delete-users-in-power-platform)
