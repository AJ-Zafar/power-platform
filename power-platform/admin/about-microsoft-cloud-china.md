# Model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 - operated by 21Vianet in China

Common Data Service services operated by 21Vianet is designed to comply with regulatory requirements in China. The services are a physically separated environment of cloud services operated and transacted currently by a local operator, Shanghai Blue Cloud Technology Co., Ltd (“21Vianet”). This is a wholly owned subsidiary of Beijing 21Vianet Broadband Data Center Co., Ltd. located in mainland China.

Microsoft strives to maintain functional parity between our commercially available service and model-driven apps in Dynamics 365, such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Customer Service, - operated by 21Vianet in China. However, there are notable exceptions to this affected by dependent service or partner-solution availability, market priorities, or compliance regulations.

## Provisioning

Customers in China have two options from which to select how they want to access model-driven apps in Dynamics 365.

- Services operated by 21Vianet in China - 21Vianet operates and offers Common Data Service services in China. This option provides a consistent model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 experience that is the same as global offerings. This option also meets the demands of customers who prefer to use online services provided by a local company that stores their data within China. These services are subject to Chinese laws.

- Services operated by Microsoft – This option is for customers that prefer to use services managed and delivered by Microsoft. For all new customers and existing customers, if the customer purchases Microsoft Azure, model-driven apps in Dynamics 365, and Office using an Enterprise Agreement, Office 365 and/or model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 can co-exist on the tenant. 

There are a few technical limitations during the provisioning of services that need to be taken in to account to avoid potential issues. 

|Scenario  |Recommendation  |
|---------|---------|
|**Purchased Azure, Office 365, and model-driven apps in Dynamics 365, such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Customer Service, via OSPA.**    |Recommended sequence for provisioning: Office 365 or model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 must be provisioned first, followed by Azure.|
|**Purchased Azure via OSPA first and then purchased Office 365 via OSPA. Now purchased model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 via OSPA.**   | Customer already has two tenants, one for Azure and another for Office 365. model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 can be added to the tenant containing Office 365 OSPA.        |
|**Purchase Office 365 via OSPA and then purchased Azure via OSPA. Now purchased Dynamics 365, such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Customer Service, via OSPA.**     | Customer started with Office 365 and then added Azure. Model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 can be provisioned on the same tenant.        |
|**Purchased Office 365 via OSPA and plans to add model-driven apps in Dynamics 365.**   |If Office 365 is already provisioned, customer will be able to provision model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 on the same tenant.         |
|**Purchased Office 365 via OSSA or CSP and purchased model-driven apps in Dynamics 365, such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Customer Service.**    |model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 needs to be provisioned on a separate tenant.          |
