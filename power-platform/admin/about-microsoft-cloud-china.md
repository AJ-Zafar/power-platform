# Power Platform and Dynamics 365 apps - operated by 21Vianet in China

Microsoft Power Platform and Dynamics 365 apps services operated by 21Vianet is designed to comply with regulatory requirements in China. The services are a physically separated environment of cloud services operated and transacted currently by a local operator, Shanghai Blue Cloud Technology Co., Ltd (“21Vianet”). This is a wholly owned subsidiary of Beijing 21Vianet Broadband Data Center Co., Ltd. located in mainland China.

## Provisioning

Customers in China have two options from which to select how they want to access Power Platform and Dynamics 365 apps.

- Services operated by 21Vianet in China - 21Vianet operates and offers Dataverse services in China. This option provides a consistent Power Platform and Dynamics 365 apps experience that is the same as global offerings. This option also meets the demands of customers who prefer to use online services provided by a local company that stores their data within China. These services are subject to Chinese laws.

- Services operated by Microsoft – This option is for customers that prefer to use services managed and delivered by Microsoft. For all new customers and existing customers, if the customer purchases Microsoft Azure, Power Platform and Dynamics 365 apps, and Office using an Enterprise Agreement, Microsoft 365 and/or Power Platform and Dynamics 365 apps can co-exist on the tenant. 

For information on provisioning environments, see [Create and manage environments in the Power Platform admin center](./create-environment.md).

## Feature availability

The deployment of business applications in each geography is built on the foundational principles of security, privacy, compliance, transparency, reliability, and in-country disaster recovery, offering organizations a complete cloud infrastructure and platform, as well as familiar productivity and business application tools. This means that customer data is stored at rest within the geography, except as noted in the [Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/privacy/data-location). 

Microsoft strives to maintain functional parity across our localized data center deployments. However, there are exceptions affected by dependent service availability, market priorities, or compliance regulations. These exceptions are indicated through the **Product and Feature Availability PDF** (refer to the column labeled China (21-V) to help customers and partners understand and plan for successful implementation of their business application solutions. Microsoft continues to evaluate these services and capabilities for inclusion and updates in future releases.
