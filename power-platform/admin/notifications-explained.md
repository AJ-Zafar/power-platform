# Notifications for Business & Industry Copilot services

Microsoft regularly sends communications regarding service changes, maintenance, retirement, and customer action needed. These communications come primarily in the form of a post to the Microsoft 365 Service health dashboard and the Message center. Occasionally, we will also use direct email communications to provide status, updates, or information about the service.  

## Message center
Admins can use the [Microsoft 365 Message center](/office365/admin/manage/message-center?view=o365-worldwide) to keep track of upcoming changes, including new and changed features, planned maintenance, or other important announcements. Email notifications can be enabled for message center posts. 

## Service health dashboard
The [Service health dashboard](/office365/enterprise/view-service-health) shows the health status of your Microsoft services. To learn how to get to the Microsoft 365 Service health dashboard, see [Check your service health](check-online-service-health.md). 

Service health communications in the M365 admin center are limited to certain admin roles. [Assign admin roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/assign-admin-roles?view=o365-worldwide) that have permission to view Service health and review them regularly to stay current on the latest Service health information.

Sometimes we may need to notify you of issues occurring in your managed environment, where an admin or user in your organization may need to take action to resolve. These communications will appear in Service health under the section titled [“Issues in your environment that require action”](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-monitoring?view=o365-worldwide).

## Service health in PPAC
On the [Power Platform admin center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/admin-documentation) home page dashboard, admins can add Service health and Message center cards for a quicker view of incidents and upcoming changes.

Admins can view service health issues for the last 30 days from the **Help + support** page, under the **Service health** tab. 

## Email service notifications
The notifications sent from the Business & Industry Copilot communications team will be for the following services and email addresses.  Be sure to check your spam folder for these messages.

|Service | Notification Email | 
| ------------- | -------------| 
| Microsoft Dynamics 365 apps   | msdynamics365@microsoft.com  | 
| Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations apps  | msdyn365finops@microsoft.com|

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting December 1, 2024, only users assigned to the Dynamics 365 administrator or Power Platform administrator role in the Microsoft 365 admin center or Microsoft Entra admin center will receive email notifications.
