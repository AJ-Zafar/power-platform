# Data policies

A principal capability of a managed environment is enforcing policies that define the consumer connectors that specific data can be shared with. These policies are called data loss prevention (DLP) policies. DLP policies ensure that data is managed in a uniform manner across your organization, and they prevent important business data from being accidentally published to connectors such as social media sites. For more information on creating and managing DLP policies, see [Data loss prevention policies](wp-data-loss-prevention.md).
