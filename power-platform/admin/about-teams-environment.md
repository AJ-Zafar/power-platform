# About Teams environment

## Lifecycle

- A Teams environment is bound to a team. It’s created during first app acquisition or creation in a team, bound to the Microsoft 365 group. A Teams environment is deleted when a Team is deleted, or all apps deleted.​
- The Microsoft 365 group associated with a Teams environment cannot be edited and it’s only controlled by Teams.​
- Teams  environments will be available in a separate view/filter in the Power Platform admin center.​
- A Teams environment cannot be converted to other environment types unless promoted. ​
- Non-essential settings will not be editable in Teams environments.​
- Teams environments are managed differently in the admin center by Tenant admins (P1) and Team owners (P2).

## Promotion lifecycle

- Tenant Admin can promote a Teams environment from a Teams environment to a Production environment.​
- CDS-Lite environment promotes to a CDS-Full. After promotion:​
  - The M365 Group association now becomes editable.​
  - Team owners will no longer have access to this environment, unless they are explicitly assigned the sys admin role.​
  - Team deletion or M365 group deletion will not delete the CDS-Full environment.​
  - Adding a new Teams Template app to the Team will create a new CDS-Lite for the Team.
