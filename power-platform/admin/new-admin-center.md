# New and imporoved Power Platform admin center
                                                  
We are happy to announce the Public Preview of the new Power Platform Admin Center! 

The new Power Platform Admin Center is an outcome-driven hub experience, where all experiences are logically grouped into pages based on Jobs to be done by an admin in PPAC! 

The experiences in the new Power Platform Admin Center will not only be task-oriented but will also focus on achieving specific outcomes and goals. They are designed to ensure optimal user experience and cater to a wide array of stakeholders with diverse needs.â€¯

## When and how can customers benefit from the new experience 

The new Power Platform Admin Center will be in public preview for all customers starting November 24, 2024 (customers in some regions might be able to enjoy the new experience sooner as well) .  

In order to use the new User Experience, admins need to turn on the toggle in the top right corner of the existing PPAC.

Upon turning on the toggle, customers will be able to transact in the new Power Platform Admin Center, with the richness of a new UI as well as logically grouped pages! 

If admins choose to go back to the classic PPAC from the new PPAC, they can turn off the toggle at the top right corner. 

## Where are the pages from classic PPAC in new PPAC?  

Most of the pages from the classic PPAC are available in either the same form or with enhanced experiences in the new PPAC. The location of these pages in the new PPAC is as follows:

## What is new in the new PPAC 

In addition to a reorganization of pages into groups based on admin Jobs to be done,  new experiences in the form of Monitoring pages are being introduced! Through these pages, admins and makers will be able to monitor performance related statistics in their tenant, like - identify when end-users cannot access an app or when a set of Power Pages are slow.  

These new experiences help organizations measure and improve the operational health of their resources, such as apps. Admins can use these experiences to understand the overall operational health within their tenant or within specific environments. Metrics are derived from aggregated event logs from runtime activities, and recommendations are based on these logs or static analysis of resource properties. Event logs used for metric calculations are available for review and download to assist in operational health analysis. 

## What can we expect next 

Over the next several months, new experiences will be added to the Power Platform Admin Center, to assist admins in their day-to-day jobs. Amongst others, these will include ALM experiences. 

Through recurring updates, information about these experiences will be made public.
