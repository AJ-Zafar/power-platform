## When and how can customers benefit from the new experience?

The new Power Platform admin center is in public preview for all customers starting November 24, 2024. Customers in some regions might be able to enjoy the new experience sooner, as well.  

In order to use the new user experience, admins need to turn on the **Try the new admin center** toggle in the top-right corner of the existing admin center.

After you turn on the toggle, customers can use the new Power Platform admin center, with the richness of a new UI and logically grouped pages. 

If admins choose to go back to the classic admin center from the new and improved admin center, they can turn off the toggle at the top-right corner.

## What else is included in the new admin center? 

In addition to a reorganization of pages into groups based on admin tasks to be done, new experiences in the form of _monitoring pages_ are being introduced! Through these pages, admins and makers can monitor performance-related statistics in their tenant, such as identify when end users can't access an app or when a set of Power Pages are slow.  

These new experiences help organizations measure and improve the operational health of their resources, such as apps. Admins can use these experiences to understand the overall operational health within their tenant or within specific environments. Metrics are derived from aggregated event logs from runtime activities, and recommendations are based on these logs or static analysis of resource properties. Event logs used for metric calculations are available for review and download to help operational health analysis. 

## What can we expect next? 

Over the next several months, new experiences will be added to the Power Platform admin center to assist admins in their day-to-day jobs. These tasks will include ALM experiences, as well. 

Through recurring updates, information about these experiences will be made public.
