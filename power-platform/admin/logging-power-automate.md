# View Power Automate audit logs 

You can find logs of Power Automate activities in the [Microsoft 365 compliance center](https://compliance.microsoft.com/). These logs are also accessible to developers via the [Office 365 Management API](/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-apis-overview).

## Access the logs

1.  Sign into the [compliance center](https://compliance.microsoft.com/) as a tenant admin.
1.  In the left hamburger menu, select **Show all**.
1. Select **Audit** from the **Solutions** category. 
    
    ![Select audit from the menu](./media/audit-logs/show-all.png)

Power Platform admins can search the **Audit** screen for details from the following popular services.

- Power BI
- Azure AD
- Microsoft Teams
- Dynamics 365
- Power Apps,
- Power Automate
- Dataverse.

Administrators can filter for specific activities via the **Activities** list. You will find the Power Automate activities within this list.

## See audited events

All logging is done at the SDK layer, so a single action can trigger multiple logged events. Here's a sample of the user events that you can audit.

Event | Description
-|-
|Created flow | The time a flow was created|
|Edited flow | Any updates made to the flow|
|Deleted flow | When the flow was deleted|
|Edited permissions | Every time a user's permissions to the flow changes|
|Deleted permissions | Every time a user's permissions to the flow is removed|
|Started a paid trial | When the user starts a paid trial|
|Renewed a paid trial | When the user renews a paid trial|
