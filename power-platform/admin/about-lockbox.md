# Power Platform Lockbox 

If you have an issue that requires Microsoft support to access your data, you can use Power Platform Lockbox to approve or reject data access requests from Microsoft. With Lockbox, you can:
1. Create data-access polices
2. Approve or reject data access requests

## Create and enable Lockbox policies

Tenant admins can create or update the Lockbox policies,

To enable Lockbox policy, tenant admins need to login to the admin portal and enable Lockbox policy for all environments or for some environments.





> [!NOTE]
> If you enable the Lockbox feature for your organization, every data access by Microsoft will be regulated and will require an explicit approval from the designated approver in your organizationâ€‹
