## Power Apps - license utilization

License utilization reports provide insights into tenant and environment utilization of Dynamics 365 licenses based on Power Apps usage. The report answers questions such as:

- What is the total number of Dynamics 365 Per User licenses purchased for my tenant or environments?
- How many Dynamics 365 Per User licenses have been assigned across the tenant or environments?
- What is the ratio of Per User licenses actively used in past 28 days compared to the total number of licenses assigned?
- Which active users are assigned to one or more Dynamics 365 Per User license?
- How many applications are being used by licensed users across the tenant or environments?
- When was the last session for an active user that's been assigned a Dynamics 365 Per User license?
- Which applications are being used by licensed users across the tenant or environments?
