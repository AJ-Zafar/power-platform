# Set incoming and outgoing email synchronization 

You have several options for synchronizing email messages with Microsoft Dataverse or customer engagement apps (such as Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation). Use the following information to deploy the best option for your company.
  
## Set the synchronization method  
You can set the default synchronization method applied to all newly created user mailboxes:  
  
1. In the  [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com), select an environment. 

2. On the command bar, select **Settings** > **Email** > **Email settings**.  
  
You can set the synchronization method for individual mailboxes:  

1. In the Power Platform admin center, select an environment. 

2. Select **Settings** > **Mailboxes**, and then select a mailbox.
  
For information on picking a synchronization method, see [Integrate your email system](integrate-synchronize-your-email-system.md).  
  
## Incoming email messaging options  
The available incoming email configurations that you can use when a user or a queue receives email messages are as follows:
  
- **None**. Use this option for users or queues that do not use customer engagement apps to track received email messages. 
  
- **Dynamics 365 for Outlook**. This option is deprecated for Power Platform and Microsoft Dataverse. This option is only available for On-premise deployments. More information: [Dynamic 365 for Outlook is deprecated](/important-changes-coming#dynamic-365-for-outlook-is-deprecated)
  
- **Server-Side Synchronization or Email Router**. When you select this option, the server-side synchronization or email router will process email messages directly from the user's or queue's inbox, without using a forward or a sink mailbox. 
  
- **Forward Mailbox**. This option requires a sink mailbox, which is a dedicated mailbox that collects email messages transferred from each user's mailbox by a server-side rule. Although, this option doeen't require users to run Outlook, it does require that the rule be deployed for each user. You use the **Rule Deployment Wizard** to deploy rules to each user mailbox. This option was provided for initial migration to server-side synchronization from previous versions of Dynamics 365. It isn't a recommended option as a long-term solution due to performance reasons. More information: [Forward mailbox vs. individual mailboxes](forward-mailbox-vs-individual-mailboxes.md) 
  
## Outgoing email messaging options  
The available outgoing email configurations that you can use when users or queues send email messages are as follows:
  
- **None**. Use this option for users or queues that do not use customer engagement apps to send email messages. 
  
- **Dynamics 365 for Outlook**. This option is deprecated for Power Platform and Dataverse. This option is only available for On-premise deployments. More information: [Dynamic 365 for Outlook is deprecated](/important-changes-coming#dynamic-365-for-outlook-is-deprecated) 
  
- **Server-Side Synchronization or Email Router**. This option delivers email messages by using the server-side synchronization or email router component. The email system must be SMTP-compliant. The server-side synchronization or email router can be installed on the SMTP server or on a different computer that has a connection to the SMTP server.


## Find the right combitation of settings 

Email auto tracking behavior for a given user or queue is a combination of personal options and system settings. In addition to synchronization methods described above, server-side sync honors a user's [personal email options](/powerapps/user/set-personal-options#email-tab-options) and environment level [system settings](system-settings-dialog-box-email-tab.md). 

To help you find the right combitation of settings for your organization, see [Community forum: Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement â€“ How to choose System Settings and Personal Options for automatic Email tracking](https://community.dynamics.com/crm/b/crminthefield/posts/dynamics-365-customer-engagement-how-to-choose-system-settings-and-personal-options-for-automatic-email-tracking).
