# Access control (preview)
[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]
                                                  
Access controls are a fundamental aspect of securing modern IT environments, particularly within cloud-based platforms such as Azure Virtual Networks and Power Platform. These controls are designed to ensure that only authorized users can access specific resources, thereby protecting sensitive data and maintaining the integrity of organizational systems.

- **Tenant isolation**: This feature is applicable to Managed and non-Managed Environments at the tenant level. Tenant isolation lets global administrators and Power Platform administrators govern the movement of tenant data from Microsoft Entra-authorized data sources to and from their tenant. For more information, see [Cross-tenant inbound and outbound restrictions](../cross-tenant-restrictions.md).

- **Data policies**: This feature is applicable at both tenant-level and environment-level to both Managed Environments and non-Managed Environments. Setting up data policies at the environment or tenant-level acts as guardrails to help reduce the risk of users from unintentionally exposing organizational data. For more information, see [Data policies](../wp-data-loss-prevention.md).
  > [!Note]
  > The recommendation for data policies is triggered when there is no tenant-level policy defined. At this time, any environment-scoped data policies are not considered when performing the security assessment for the tenant.

- **Environment security group**: This feature is applicable to both Managed Environments and non-Managed Environments. Setting up security groups helps control which licensed users can access environments. For more information, see [Control user access to environments: security groups and licenses](../control-user-access.md).

- **Sharing**: This feature is applicable to Managed Environments only. Sharing gives administrators, the ability to control who and what their makers can share (like canvas apps, cloud flows and copilots) with other individual users and security groups, thereby ensuring that sensitive information is available only to authorized users, reducing the risk of data breachers and misuse. For more information, see [Limit sharing](../managed-environment-sharing-limits.md)

- **Client application access control**
You can protect against data exfiltration by managing and controlling what apps can run in your Dataverse environment. Data exfiltration safeguards prevent sensitive information from unauthorized removal or extraction from your environment. This safeguard allows a business to maintain business continuity, comply with regulatory requirements, and keep up with competitive advantage.
When this capability is enabled in an environment, you can configure which apps are allowed or blocked in your environment. Malicious users canâ€™t create or use unapproved apps to export sensitive data out of the environment.

- **Administrator Privileges**
You can improve the security posture of your tenant by limiting the number of users who have high privileged administrative roles in Microsoft Entra ID and Power Platform. This feature enables you to review users who have these privileged roles, review the user list, and remove users who should no longer have privileged access. [Learn more](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2271320).
  > [!Note]
  >  Only users with the Global administrator role can remove other users from the Global administrator role.

- **Guest Access**
You can bolster your security score by prohibiting guest access to your environment. This feature restricts anyone who is designated as a guest in your tenant in Microsoft Entra from interacting with any resources that have been shared with them or that they made.

  > About Microsoft Graph connectors: Items made in Copilot Studio may use Graph connectors as knowledge sources, and the information in them may be accessible to guests for now even if this setting is on.
