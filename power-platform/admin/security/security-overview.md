The Security page in the Power Platform admin center is designed to enhance your organization's security and streamline management. The Security page provides a centralized location to view and manage security recommendations, assess your security score, and implement proactive policies to safeguard your organization.

With Security, administrators can:

- **Assess Security score:** Understand and improve your organization’s security policies with the Security Score. This score is illustrated on a qualitative scale (Low, Medium, High) and helps you measure your organizational security position for Power Platform workloads. 
- **Act on recommendations:** Identify and implement impactful recommendations generated by the system based on best practices to improve your tenant's security score.
- **Manage proactive policies:** Manage proactive policies for governance and security, including Network Security, Access Controls, Threat Detection, and Compliance.

## Prerequisite
To see your security score, recommendations you must turn on tenant-wide analytics. For instructions, see [How do I enable tenant-level analytics?](../tenant-level-analytics.md#how-do-i-enable-tenant-level-analytics).

> [!Note]
> It might take up to 48 hours to populate the Security page with data after you turn on tenant-wide analytics. Until then, most sections on the page show “Not available”.

## Accessing the Security Page 
To access the Security page, you must have Microsoft Entra ID roles such as Power Platform Administrator or Dynamics 365 Administrator. Follow these steps: 
1.	Go to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).
2.	From the left-side menu, select **Security**.

   Learn more about these roles at [Use service admin roles to manage your tenant](../use-service-admin-role-manage-tenant.md).

## Key capabilities

## Security score (Preview)
The Security Score is calculated based on the security features turned on in your environments. It provides a measurement of your organizational security position for Power Platform workloads. The score is calculated using the formula: (your score / total possible score) * 100.

- **Qualitative Scale:** The Security Score is illustrated on a qualitative scale with labels of Low (0 to 50), Medium (51-80), or High (81-100). The more security features you have turned on, the higher your security score. Medium and High assessment labels indicate that more recommended actions have been taken, improving the security position of the tenant.
- **Feature Impact:** Each security feature is assigned a score based on its scope and the number of resources impacted by turning the feature on or off. As new security features are added, the total possible score may change, which can affect your overall score even if your settings remain the same.
- **Score Calculation Formula:** The Security Score is calculated using the formula:
 (your score / total possible score) * 100

For example, if you have a tenant with 10 environments (five Managed Environments and five non-Managed Environments), and you have the following features configured:
- IP Firewall: On in 2 of 10 environments (2 points)
- Tenant Isolation: On in 10 of 10 environments (10 points)
- Environment Security Group: On in 5 of 10 environments (5 points)
Your total score would be (2 + 10 + 5 = 17) and the total possible score would be 30. Using the formula, your Security Score would be: (17/30) *100 = 56.66%

> [!Important]
> Security score refreshes every 24 hours and any action taken could take up to 24 hours to reflect the updated score.

## **Reactive governance through recommendations**
The system generates recommendations based on best practices and guide to improve your tenant's security score. These recommendations can be acted upon to enhance your overall security score only for managed environments. For non-managed environments you can still act or enable recommended features.

- An admin can take relevant actions for a specific recommendation by selecting environment.
- Each recommendation guides through the potential score increase to overall Security score.
- These recommendations span all environments, but you can only take action on them in environments that are managed.
- Recommendations can only be applied to managed environments here. To apply this feature to more environments, go to the settings pages in Security, find this feature, and turn it on for non-managed environments there.
