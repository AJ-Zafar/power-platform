# View the fields that are synchronized between model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 and Outlook

In [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_2015_outlook](../includes/pn-crm-2015-outlook.md)] or later, you can view the appointments, contacts, and tasks fields that are synchronized between model-driven apps in Dynamics 365, such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Customer Service, and [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] so you can see where the data is coming from. You can also determine whether the fields:  

- Are synchronized one way (from [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] to model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 **or** from model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 to [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)])  

- Are synchronized two way (from [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] to model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 **and** from model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 to [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)])  

- Aren't synchronized  

  For example, if the fields are synchronized one way, from model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 to [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)], you can update the field in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] and save the change, but your changes won't be synced with model-driven apps in Dynamics 365, and will be overwritten if the same field value is changed in model-driven apps in Dynamics 365. So if fields are synced one way, there's no need to change the value in the synchronized field.  

## View the synchronized fields  

1. In the web app, in the upper-right corner of the screen, click the **Settings** button ![User profile Settings button](media/privileges-user.png "User profile Settings button") > **Options**.  

2. In the **Set Personal Options** dialog box, choose the **Synchronization** tab.    

3. Choose **synchronized fields**.  

4. In the **Synchronization Settings for [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)]** dialog box, click the **Synchronization Fields** tab.  

   ![Field-level Sync tab](media/field-level-sync-tab.png "Field-level Sync tab")  

5. In the **Entity Type** list, select the record type you want to view.  

   [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] fields are displayed on the left and the corresponding model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 fields are displayed on the right. The blue arrows show the sync direction:

   > [!NOTE]
   >  Field synchronization direction can be impacted by security settings configured by your system administrator. For example, if you don't have read privileges for a field, it won't be synchronized in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] even if the field is configured for two-way synchronization. To determine whether you have read privileges for a field, click the **View in Dynamics 365 apps** button to open the record. If you see the **Lock** icon, you can't access the field.
