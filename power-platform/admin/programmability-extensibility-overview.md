# Programmability and extensibility overview
Power Platform administrators often times have the need to orchestrate and automate routine activities for their tenant.  This can be accomplished in a variety of ways, using the tools outlined below.  

> [!NOTE]
> Programmability tools are currently developed API-first, meaning new properties and functionality will first be exposed in the latest API versions made available.  They will later be uptaken in to updates to our PowerShell commandlets and Connectors.  In the future, this will become synchronized across all available tools.  

## Available tools
Today, there are three programmability tools available for administrators to use.  These increase in complexity and also flexibility.  Over time, more first-party libraries will become available in a variety of programming languages.  To keep up with the latest updates, please review the [Release Notes](linkhere.co).

### Management Connectors
Connectors are the easiest to get started if you are new to automation.  With a graphical workflow editor based on Power Automate, these allow admins to quickly get a routine task implemented.  For more information, see the [Connectors - Getting started](linkhere.co).

### PowerShell Commandlets
PowerShell is a common automation tool at organizations worldwide.  For more information, see the [Power Platform PowerShell Module for Administrators - Getting started](linkhere.c0).

### Power Platform API
The most advanced tool available, it has full parity with what is possible in the Power Platform admin center.  For more information, see the [Power Platform API - Getting started](linkhere.co).

## Next steps
Regardless of which tool you choose, you will want to review the following articles to get started:
