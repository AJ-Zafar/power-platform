# Datacenter regions

Microsoft Power Platform and Dynamics 365 apps (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation), are being hosted in datacenters in more and more regions. After customer engagement apps become available in a new region, the following apply:  
  
- For new organizations, the datacenter will be aligned with the country/region you selected during sign-up.  
  
- For existing organizations, [!INCLUDE[cc_Microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] will soon accommodate migrations to datacenters in the new region when requested by the customer as long as the organization meets certain business requirements.  
  
The following table lists the newest datacenter regions. See [Where your data is located](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/privacy/data-location)
