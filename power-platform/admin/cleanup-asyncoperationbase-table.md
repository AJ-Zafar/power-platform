# Clean up records from AsyncOperationBase and WorkflowLogBase tables

The AsyncOperationBase table is used to store system jobs. System jobs represent asynchronous extensions, such as asynchronous registered workflows and plugins, and other background operations such as bulk deletion, bulk import, and rollup operations. After an event occurs and any synchronous extensions have been processed, the platform serializes the context for any asynchronous extensions and saves it to the database as an AsyncOperation entity. 

When an async workflow is triggered in your Dataverse organization, a record will be created in the AsyncOperationBase table to track the processing of the async job.Additional records will also be created in the WorkflowLogBase table to maintain logs for the workflow execution. [Business process flows](/power-automate/business-process-flows-overview) (BPF) also store BPF stage transition and action logs for the BPF in the WorkflowLogBase table. 

If your organization has heavy use of workflows or business process flows, these tables will grow over time and eventually become large enough to introduce performance issues as well as consume excessive storage in your organization database.

## Bulk deletion jobs

All environments are configured with an out-of-the-box bulk deletion job to delete successfully completed workflow system jobs older than 30 days. Customers can configure additional Bulk bulk deletion to delete AsyncOperationBase records. It is recommended that the customer configures a job that deletes any completed system job (regardless of type or result) older than 30 days so that completed jobs do not accumulate in the AsyncOperationBase table. 

You can leverage the bulk delete system jobs to delete unneeded records from both AsyncOperationBase and WorkflowLogBase tables. To view the bulk deletion system jobs:

1. Sign into the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).
2. Select **Environments** in the left navigation pane, select your environment, and then select **Settings** on the top menu bar.
3. Select **Data management** > **Bulk deletion**.

You can specify which system jobs to view, such as **Recurring bulk system jobs**.

## AsyncOperationBase file capacity usage 

Historically, the entire async operation context used to be serialized directly in the AsyncOperationBase table (as **data** property), leading to very quick growth in size in case of asynchronous plugin registrations on large entities (such as attachment). Since early 2021, the data portion of async operations is moved to file capacity. As a result, async operation data size is partially counted in database capacity and partially as file capacity. This helps reduce the cost (since file capacity is charged at a lower rate than database capacity) and improves overall performance of their organization (since queries against the Async Operation entity are more performant). 

For more information on Dataverse storage model and reporting, see [New Microsoft Dataverse storage capacity](capacity-storage.md).
