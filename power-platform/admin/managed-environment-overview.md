# Managed environments overview

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Managed environments is a suite of capabilities that allow admins to manage Power Platform at scale with more control, less effort, and more insights. Admins can enable environment management on any type of environment. There are four primary elements of managed environments: 

- [Enable environment management](managed-environment-enable.md)
- [Weekly digests](managed-environment-weekly-digests.md)
- [Sharing limits](managed-environment-sharing-limits.md)
- [Data policies](managed-environment-data-policies.md) 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This is a preview feature.
> - Preview features aren’t meant for production use and may have restricted functionality. These features are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.
> - This feature is being gradually rolled out across regions and might not be available yet in your region.

## No new license

Managed environments represent a value-add for Power Platform premium licenses. All applications and flows in an managed environment are premium and can be licensed using any of the Power Platform licensing options (per user, per app/flow or pay-as-you-go) or D365 licenses that give premium usage rights. 

During the public preview the premium license requirement for applications and flows within a managed environment is not enforced.
