# Manage collaboration settings

Use Collaboration settings to adjust how how collaboration features work in Power Platform.

These settings can be found in the Power Platform admin center by going to **Environments** > [select an environment] > **Settings** > **Product** > **Collaboration**.

Make sure you have the System Administrator security role or equivalent permissions to update the Collaboration settings.

**Check your security role**

- Follow the steps in [View your user profile](/powerapps/user/view-your-user-profile).
- Donâ€™t have the correct permissions? Contact your system administrator.
