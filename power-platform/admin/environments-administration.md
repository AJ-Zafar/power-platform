# Manage environments in the Power Apps Admin center

> [!NOTE]
> We are moving environment management from other admin centers to the Power Platform admin center. Until this is completed, some management can be or must be done in other admin centers such as the Power Apps Admin center.

In the [Power Apps Admin center][1], manage environments that you've created and those for which you have been added to the Environment Admin or System Administrator role. From the admin center, you can perform these administrative actions:

* Create environments.
* Rename environments.
* Add or remove a user or group from either the Environment Admin or Environment Maker role.
* Provision a Common Data Service database for the environment.
* Set Data Loss Prevention policies.
* Set database security policies (as open or restricted by database roles).
* Members of the Azure AD tenant Global administrator role (includes Global admins) can also manage all environments that have been created in their tenant and set tenant-wide policies.

For more information, see [Environments overview](environments-overview.md).

## Access the Power Apps Admin center
To access the Power Apps Admin center:

* Go directly to [admin.powerapps.com][1], OR

* Go to [powerapps.com][2], and then select the gear icon in the  navigation header.

    ![Power Apps gear dropdown](./media/environment-admin/powerapps-gear-dropdown.png)

To manage an environment in the Power Apps Admin center, you must have one of these roles:

* The Environment Admin or System Administrator role of the environment, OR

* The Global Administrator role of your Azure AD or Microsoft 365 tenant.

You also need either a Power Apps plan or Power Automate plan to access the admin center. For more information, see the [Power Apps pricing page][3].

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any changes that you make in Power Apps Admin center affect the [Power Automate admin center][4] and vice versa.

## Create an environment
For instructions on how to create an environment, see [Create an environment](create-environment-powerapps.md).

## View your environments
When you open the admin center, the Environments tab appears by default and lists all the environments for which you are an Environment Admin (as shown below):

![New environment list](./media/environment-admin/environment-list-new.png)

If you are a member of the Global Administrator role of your Azure AD or Microsoft 365 tenant, all the environments that have been created by users in your tenant appear, because you're automatically an Environment Admin for all of them.

## Rename your environment
1. Open the [Power Apps Admin center][1], find the environment to be renamed in the list, and click or tap it.

    ![Environment list updated](./media/environment-admin/environment-list-updated3.png)

2. Click or tap **Details**.

    ![Environment rename details](./media/environment-admin/environment-rename-details-2.png)
3. in the **Name** text box, enter the new name, then click **Save**.

    ![Environment rename](./media/environment-admin/environment-rename-2.png)

    If you have created the database in the environment, then you will not see this option. You can rename the environment from Dynamics 365 Admin center by clicking on the link in **Details** tab.

    ![Details tab](./media/environment-admin/Delete-D365AdminCenter.png)

## Delete your environment
1. In the [Power Apps Admin center][1], click or tap the environment that you want to delete.

    ![Environment list updated3](./media/environment-admin/environment-list-updated3.png)
2. Click or tap **Details**.

    ![Environment rename details2](./media/environment-admin/environment-rename-details-2.png)
3. Click or tap **Delete environment** to delete your environment.

    ![Delete environment](./media/environment-admin/delete-environment-2.png)

## Create a Common Data Service database for an environment
If an environment doesn't already have a database, an Environment Admin can create one in the [Power Apps Admin center][1] by following these steps. Only users with a Power Apps plan  can create Common Data Service databases.

1. Select an environment in the environments table.

    ![Choose environment updated](./media/environment-admin/choose-environment-updated.png)
2. Select the **Details** tab.
3. Select **Create a database**.

    ![Create database from details](./media/environment-admin/Create-DB-From-Details.png)

After you create a database, choose a security model. For more information, see [Configure database security](database-security.md).

## Manage security for your environments
Environment security is now done in the [Power Platform admin center](add-users-to-environment.md). 

## Data policies
An organization's data must be protected so that it isn't shared with audiences that should not have access to it. To protect this data, you can create and enforce policies that define which consumer services and connector-specific business data can be shared with. Policies that define how data can be shared are referred to as data loss prevention (DLP) policies. You can manage the DLP policies for your environments  from the **Data Policies** section of the [Power Apps Admin center][1].  For more information, see [Data loss prevention policies](prevent-data-loss.md).

## Frequently asked questions

### How many environments and databases can I create?
Provisioning environments is based on the available storage in your organization. You need at least 1GB minimum database storage to create an environment.For more information, see [Environments overview](environments-overview.md). 

### Which license includes Common Data Service?
Power Apps plan.  See [Power Apps pricing page][3] for details on all the plans that include this license.

### While trying to create a new environment, I am getting an error. How should I resolve it?
If you are getting the following error message: "Either your plan doesn't support the environment type selected or you've reached the limit for that type of environment.", it can mean one of the two things:

1. You have already utilized your quota to create a specific type of environments. Say you were creating  a trial environment and you get this error message. That means, that you have already provisioned two trial environments. You can view all the environments in [Power Apps Admin center][1].
If you want, you can delete an existing environment of that specific type and create a new one. But, please make sure that you don't lose your data, apps, flows and other resources which you want to retain.

2. You do not have a quota to create that specific type of the environment. <!-- Check what type of environment you can create [here](environments-overview.md#creating-an-environment). -->

If you are getting any other error message or have more questions, please connect with us [here][5].

### When will my trial environment expire?   
Trial environments expire after 30 days from their creation. If you don't want your trial environments to expire, you can convert them to production environments. 

### Does my current database (created with previous version of the Common Data Service) also gets counted in the quota?
If you had a database (created with previous version of the Common Data Service), they will also get counted with your production environment quota. If you now create a database in an environment (created prior to March 15, 2018) then it will also get counted as production environment.

### Can I rename an environment?
Yes, this functionality is available from the Power Apps Admin center. See [Environments Administration](environments-administration.md#rename-your-environment) for more details.

### Can I delete an environment?
Yes, this functionality is available from the Power Apps Admin center. See [Environments Administration](environments-administration.md#delete-your-environment) for more details.

Please note that you currently can't delete a production environment with a database (with latest version of the Common Data Service). This will be coming soon!

### As an Environment Admin, can I view and manage all resources (apps, flows, APIs, etc.) for an environment?
Yes, the ability to view the apps and flows for an environment is available from the Power Apps Admin center. See [View Apps](admin-view-apps.md) for more details.
