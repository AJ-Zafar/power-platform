# Determine your environment's organization ID and name

To find your organization ID and name: 

1. Go to **Settings** (![Settings](media/settings-gear-icon.png "Settings")) > **Advanced Settings**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Select Advanced Settings](media/advanced-settings.png "Select Advanced Settings")

2. Go to **Settings** > **Customizations** > **Developer Resources**.

3. Under **Instance Reference Information**, make note of **ID** and **Unique Name**. **Unique Name** is the organization name.

> [!NOTE]
> The organization name is derived from the domain name when the environment was provisioned. You cannot change the organization name using the [Business Unit](create-edit-business-units.md) form but it can be changed using the [Web API](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/web-api/businessunit?view=dynamics-ce-odata-9).
