# Administer Power Apps

Power Apps administrators can use the Power Apps Admin center ([admin.powerapps.com](https://admin.powerapps.com)) and the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com) to manage environments and settings for Power Apps.

> [!NOTE]
> Features from the Power Apps Admin center are being moved to the Power Platform admin center. Until the move to the Power Platform admin center is complete, youâ€™ll still be able to manage environments and settings in Power Apps Admin center as usual.
