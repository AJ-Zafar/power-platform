# On-premises server cipher suites and TLS requirements 

A [cipher suite](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/secauthn/cipher-suites-in-schannel) is a set of cryptographic algorithms. This is used to encrypt messages between clients/servers and other servers.  

Before a secure connection is established, the protocol and cipher are negotiated between server and client based on availability on both sides. 

To comply with our security policy for a secure connection, your server must have the following: 

1. Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 (or higher) compliance
2. At least one of the following ciphers: 

   TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 <br />
   TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 <br />
   TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 <br />
   TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384 

You may either upgrade the [Windows version](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/secauthn/cipher-suites-in-schannel) or update the [Windows TLS registry](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/security/tls/tls-registry-settings) to make sure that you server end-point supports one of these ciphers.
