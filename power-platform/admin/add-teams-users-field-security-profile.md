# Add teams or users to a field security profile to control access

Role-based security controls access to a specific table type, record-based security controls access to individual rows, and field-level security controls access to specific columns. You can use a field security profile to manage the permission of users and teams to read, create, or write in secured columns. For example, the System Administrator field security profile gives full access to all secured columns.
