# Performance tuning and optimization

Use this information to help you plan and optimize application performance with model-driven apps in Dynamics 365, such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Customer Service.  

We recommend that you not run operations that require intensive database transactions concurrently. Similarly, donâ€™t run operations that require intensive database transactions during normal business hours when users are most likely to access the system. 

Operations that require intensive database transactions examples:
- Enabling one or more language packs
- Solution import, upgrade, delete, or export
- Install or upgrade apps from [!INCLUDE [pn-microsoft-appsource](../includes/pn-microsoft-appsource.md)] or the [!INCLUDE [pn-dyn-365-admin-center](../includes/pn-dyn-365-admin-center.md)] 
- Publishing customizations
- Large bulk record operations, such as a business unit change when the business unit has a very large number of records associated
