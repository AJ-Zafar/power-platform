# Dynamics 365 US Government 

In response to the unique and evolving requirements of the United States public sector, Microsoft has created Microsoft Dynamics 365 US Government that is available to qualified government tables in the United States. On October 11, 2016, Microsoft announced the next generation of intelligent business applications in the cloud under the brand Microsoft Dynamics 365. To this end, Microsoft Dynamics 365 US Government entails a continuity of the protected environment that was originally branded Microsoft CRM Online Government where the protections afforded to the government community cloud under the new brand are now represented by six discrete functions: 

- Sales
- Customer Service
- Field Service 
- Project Service Automation
- Finance
- Supply Chain Management


## About Dynamics 365 US Government environments and products

Select Dynamics 365 US Government products are Generally Available to customers through deployment into the Government Community Cloud (GCC).  Among other compliance commitments and reviews as documented in the Microsoft Trust Center, the service has received several agency Authority to Operate (ATOs) since it was originally launched in January, 2015. Microsoft is the first Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) to achieve a FedRAMP Joint Application Board Provisional Authority to Operate (JAB P-ATO) through the JAB Accelerated Process. In March, 2018, the service impact level was granted a FedRAMP JAB High P-ATO.

As of April, 2019, eligible customers may choose to deploy select Dynamics 365 US Government products to the “**GCC High**” environment, which enables single sign-on and seamless integration with Microsoft 365 GCC High deployments. Microsoft has designed the platform and our operational procedures to meet the requirements aligning with the DISA SRG IL4 compliance framework. We anticipate our US Department of Defense contractor customer base and other Federal agencies currently leveraging Microsoft 365 GCC High to use the Dynamics 365 US Government GCC High deployment option, which enables and requires the customer to leverage Azure AD Government for customer identities, in contrast to GCC which leverages Public Azure AD. For our US Department of Defense contractor customer base, Microsoft operates the service in a manner that enables these customers to meet ITAR commitment and DFARS acquisition regulations, as documented and required by their contracts with the US Department of Defense.

Beginning April, 2021, eligible customers may choose to deploy select Dynamics 365 US Government products to the “**DoD**” environment, which enables single sign-on and seamless integration with Microsoft 365 DoD deployments. Microsoft has designed the platform and our operational procedures to meet the requirements aligning with the DISA SRG IL5 compliance framework. We anticipate our US Department of Defense customer base and other Federal agencies currently leveraging Microsoft 365 DoD to use the Dynamics 365 US Government DOD deployment option, which enables and requires the customer to leverage Azure AD Government for customer identities.  Microsoft operates the service in a manner that enables these customers to meet ITAR commitment and DFARS acquisition regulations, as documented and required by their contracts with the US Department of Defense.
