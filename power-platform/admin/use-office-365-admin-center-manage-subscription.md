# Use the Microsoft 365 admin center to manage your subscription 

[The Microsoft 365 admin center](https://support.office.com/article/About-the-Office-365-admin-center-758befc4-0888-4009-9f14-0d147402fd23) is a portal site rich in features for the administrator.

## Manage environments and updates in the Dynamics 365 Administration Center  
 The [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-dyn-365-admin-center.md)] is your portal site to manage environments and updates.  
  
 You access the portal by choosing model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 from the left-side menu in the [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-office-365-admin-center.md)].

## Check your service health  
 You can quickly get real-time status of your model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 and [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] services. The Service health page on the [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-office-365-admin-center.md)] provides a comprehensive view of the service health of your online services. If users are having trouble signing in to model-driven apps in Dynamics 365, check this page to see if there is a service outage.  
  
For more information, see [Check your service health](check-online-service-health.md).

<a name="BKMK_ManageUsers"></a>   

## Manage users  
 Each user signs in to model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 with an [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] user ID (more precisely, an [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_active_directory](../includes/pn-azure-active-directory.md)] user ID, see the following Note). Access to model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 is controlled through the [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] user ID.  
  
 You use the [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-office-365-admin-center.md)] to add, edit, and delete users and to reset passwords.  
  
 ![Microsoft 365 admin center active users](../admin/media/o365-admin-center-manage-users.png "Microsoft 365 admin center active users")  
  
> [!NOTE]
> Model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 use [Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-whatis) as its identity provider. You access model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 through an [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_active_directory](../includes/pn-azure-active-directory.md)] user ID that is created and managed in the [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-office-365-admin-center.md)]. For simplicity, we'll refer to the [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_active_directory](../includes/pn-azure-active-directory.md)] user ID as the [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] user ID in this documentation.  
  
 If your company uses on-premises [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Directory](../includes/pn-active-directory.md)] for user identity, you have options that can simplify user management such as providing a single sign-on experience for your users.

## Manage subscriptions  
 Use the Subscriptions page to adjust licenses, view your bill, add a partner of record, and lots more.  
  
 ![Microsoft 365 admin center subscriptions](../admin/media/o365-admin-center-manage-subscriptions.png "Microsoft 365 admin center subscriptions")  
  
<a name="BKMK_SetPassword"></a>   
## Set the password expiration  
 Use the Security & privacy page to set how frequently a user's password expires and the number of days before a user is notified of an upcoming expiration.  
  
 ![Microsoft 365 admin center manage password expiration](../admin/media/o365-admin-center-password-expiration.png "Microsoft 365 admin center manage password expiration")  
  
> [!TIP]
>  Note the information on this page about users doing their own password reset. To enable your users to be able to reset their passwords themselves, you'll need to purchase an [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_active_directory](../includes/pn-azure-active-directory.md)] subscription and configure it for password self-service. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Self-service password reset in Azure AD: how to enable, configure, and test self-service password reset](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/quickstart-sspr#enable-self-service-password-reset)  
  
<a name="BKMK_PasswordSelfSet"></a>   
## Configure self-service password reset and other settings in Azure  
 If you have an [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_active_directory](../includes/pn-azure-active-directory.md)] Basic or Premium subscription, you can set it up so users can do their own password reset. You can access [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_active_directory](../includes/pn-azure-active-directory.md)] configuration from the [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-office-365-admin-center.md)]. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Enable users to reset their Azure AD passwords](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-passwords-getting-started/#enable-users-to-reset-their-azure-ad-passwords)  
  
 On the left-side menu of the [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-office-365-admin-center.md)], choose **Admin centers** > **Azure AD**. Select your subscription in [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Azure](../includes/pn-windows-azure.md)] and then choose **Configure**.  
  
 ![Azure Active Directory password policy](../admin/media/o365-admin-center-azure-ad.png "Azure Active Directory password policy")  
  
<a name="BKMK_AddDomain"></a>   
## Add your domain  
 Use the Manage domains page to add your domain to your subscription. When you add your own domain, user sign-ins can match your company's URL. For example, instead of user@contoso.onmicrosoft.com, it could be user@contoso.com. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Verify your domain in Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/Verify-your-domain-in-Office-365-6383f56d-3d09-4dcb-9b41-b5f5a5efd611)

<a name="BKMK_PurchaseServices"></a>   
## Purchase services  
 On the left-side menu of the [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-office-365-admin-center.md)], click **Billing** > **Purchase services** to add licenses or purchase new online services.
