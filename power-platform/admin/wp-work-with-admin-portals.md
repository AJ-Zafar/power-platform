# Working with the admin portals

We've consolidated most admin tasks into the Power Platform admin center. There are a few other portals you should be aware of. The following outlines the different portals and the most common tasks you perform there.

|Portal  |Common Tasks  |
|---------|---------|
|Power Platform admin center <br/>https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com     |This portal can be used for environment management, to submit Dynamics 365 and Microsoft Power Automate focused support tickets, and to view Power Apps and Power Automate admin analytics.  | 
|Power Apps <br/>https://make.powerapps.com     |This portal is focused on building Power Apps but can also view and manage Dataverse components, manage connectors and gateways. You can also see application statistics from details on apps here.         |
|Microsoft 365 admin center <br/>https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal     |Here you will manage users and their license assignment as well as you can launch into many of the individual admin centers from here.         |
|Microsoft Azure<br/>https://portal.azure.com     |Advanced Azure AD management tasks like conditional access is managed here. Also if you support any developer application registration it is also done here. This is also where you start setup of your on-premises gateways.         |
