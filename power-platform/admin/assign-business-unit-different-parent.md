# Assign business units

Use the settings below to assign a business unit to a different parent business or change a user's business unit.

## Assign a business unit to a different parent business

You can assign a different parent business to a business unit to accommodate changes in your business requirements. When you reassign a business unit, any child business units are also reassigned with it.  
  
1. In the Microsoft Power Platform admin center, select an environment. 

2. Select **Settings** > **Users + permissions** > **Business Units**.  
  
3. Select the business unit you want to change the settings for.  
  
4. On the Actions toolbar, select **More Actions** > **Change Parent Business**.  
  
5. In the **Change Parent Business** dialog box, in the New parent business text box, type part or all of the name of the parent business you want to assign the business unit to, and then select the **Click to select a value for New parent business** icon  ![Lookup button.](media/lookup-4.png "Lookup button").
  
6. Select the record for the parent business you want to assign the business unit to, and then click **OK**.  
  
## Change a user's business unit

1. In the Microsoft Power Platform admin center, select an environment. 

2. Select **Settings** > **Users + permissions** > **Users**.  

3. Select a user and then select **Change business unit** in the top menu bar.

4. Select a business unit to assign the user to. 

   Paul need info here on Move records and other considerations. What does it mean when Select Business unit has no drop list?

5. Select **Ok**.
