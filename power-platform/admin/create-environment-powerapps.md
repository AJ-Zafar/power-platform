# Create and manage environments in the Power Apps Admin center

## Create environments

Follow these steps to create a Power Apps environment and a database for that environment.

### Prerequisites
 To follow this topic, the following items are required:
 - A Power Apps plan. Alternatively, you can sign up for a [free Power Apps trial](https://make.powerapps.com/signup).
 - Power Apps Environment Admin, Global admin, or Power Platform service admin permissions. For more information, see [Environments administration in Power Apps](environments-administration.md).

### Sign in to the Power Apps Admin center
Sign in to the Admin center at [https://admin.powerapps.com](https://admin.powerapps.com).

### Create an environment and database
1. In the navigation pane, click or tap **Environments**, and then click or tap **New environment**.

2. In the **New environment** dialog box, enter a name for the environment, and then select a region and environment type from the drop-down lists. The region  defaults to the Azure Active Directory Tenant home region, but you may select any region from the drop-down list. You cannot change the region once the environment is created. When you're done, click or tap **Create environment**.

    Select **Preview(United States)** to get early access to the upcoming Power Apps functionalities. Learn more about the [Power Apps Preview Program](preview-environments.md).
3. Once the environment is created, you'll receive a confirmation message in the dialog box and you'll be prompted to create a database. Click or tap **Create database** to enable access to the Common Data Service.

    **Note:** At this time, you can only create a database in the Azure Active Directory Tenant home region.

    It may take several minutes to create the database on the Common Data Service. Once the database is created, the new environment appears in the list of environments on the **Environments** page.

## Managing environments for your organization
In Power Apps Admin center,  you can manage all of the environments that you have created or to which you have been added to the Environment Admin role. From the Admin center, you can perform all administrative actions on an environment, including the following:

* Add or remove a user or group from either the Environment Admin or Environment Maker role.  For more information, see [Administer environments in Power Apps](environments-administration.md).
* Provision a Common Data Service database for the environment. For more information, see [Create a Common Data Service database](create-database.md).
* Set Data Loss Prevention policies. For more information, see [Data loss prevention policies](prevent-data-loss.md).
* Set database security policies (as open or restricted by database roles). For more information, see [Configure database security](database-security.md).
* Members of the Azure AD tenant Global administrator role (includes Global admins) can also manage all environments that have been created in their tenant and set tenant-wide policies from the Power Apps Admin center.
