# Manage application user from the Power Platform admin center

We are in the process of moving application user management from the legacy web client as documented in [Enable or disable application users](create-users-assign-online-security-roles.md#enable-or-disable-user-accounts).

1. Sign in to the [Power Platform Admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com)â€¯as an admin. 

2. Select **Environments**, and then select an environment from the list.

2. Select **Open environment**.

3. Select **Users + permissions**, and then select **Users**.

On the **Application Users** page you can view and manage application users.
