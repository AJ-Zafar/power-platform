1. Sign in to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).
2. Select **Environment groups** in the navigation pane.
3. On the Environment groups page, select **New group**.
4. In the **Create group** pane that appears, you can:
  A. Enter the name for the group in the **Name** field.
  B. Enter a brief description of the group in the **Description** field.
  C. Select **Create**.

## Configure the rules for your environment group
After creating an environment group, you can immediately add environments or configure its rules. Currently, there are six available rules, which are the same capabilities offered when upgrading an _individual_ environment to a Managed Environment.

1. Select the **Rules** tab.
2. Select an individual rule to open its configuration panel.
3. Edit the rule as you wish and click **Save**.
4. Repeat these steps until all desired rules have been configured.
5. Click **Publish rules**.
