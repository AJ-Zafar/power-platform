# Recover environment

You can recover a recently deleted environment ([within 7 days of deletion](backup-restore-environments.md#how-long-are-my-manualon-demand-backups-and-system-backups-retained)), by using the Power Apps cmdlet Recover-AdminPowerAppEnvironment.

```powershell  
## List soft-deleted environments
Get-AdminPowerAppSoftDeletedEnvironment
 
## Attempt a recover operation on a soft-deleted environment
Recover-AdminPowerAppEnvironment -EnvironmentName $environmentName -WaitUntilFinished $true
```  

To learn more on using PowerShell cmdlets for environments, see [Power Apps cmdlets for administrators (preview)](powerapps-powershell.md#power-apps-cmdlets-for-administrators-preview).

 
> [!NOTE]
> You should have at least 1GB of unused storage capacity to recover an environment. For information on viewing your current storage capacity, see [Common Data Service storage capacity](capacity-storage.md). 
> 
> Please review the following topics that discuss how environments could become marked for deletion and how to restore environments.
> - [Automatic environment cleanup](automatic-environment-cleanup.md)
> - [Back up and restore environments](backup-restore-environments.md).
