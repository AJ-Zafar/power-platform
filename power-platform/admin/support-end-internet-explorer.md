# Support end for Internet Explorer

Microsoft Internet Explorer support ends Aug 17th, 2021 and Microsoft Edge Legacy supported ended in Mar 2021.  This document outlines the experience that administrators and end users will see related to the support end. 

Users moving to Microsoft Edge (based on Chromium) or another supported modern browser will have a significantly improved experience.  Microsoft Edge (based on Chromium) and Chrome are twice as fast as Internet Explorer. 

## Administrator experience 

To prepare for Internet Explorer support ending, administrators in the Power Platform Admin center and in the model-driven apps Advanced Setting will see an informational message before Aug 17th 2021 and a warning message starting Aug 17th 2021 if their tenant has Internet Explorer users.  These messages will appear regardless of the browser the administrator is using.
