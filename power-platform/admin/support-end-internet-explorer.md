# Support end for Internet Explorer

Microsoft Internet Explorer support ends Aug 17th, 2021 and Microsoft Edge Legacy support ended in March 2021. This topic outlines the experience that administrators and end users will see related to the support end. 

Users moving to Microsoft Edge (based on Chromium) or another supported modern browser will have a significantly improved experience.  Microsoft Edge (based on Chromium) and Chrome are twice as fast as Internet Explorer. 

## Administrator experience 

To prepare for Internet Explorer support ending, administrators in the Power Platform Admin center and in the model-driven apps Advanced Settings will see an informational message *before* Aug 17th, 2021 and a warning message *starting* Aug 17th, 2021 if their tenant has Internet Explorer users.  These messages will appear regardless of the browser the administrator is using.

## User experience 

Starting Aug 17th 2021, all users using model-driven apps in Internet Explorer will see a warning message at the top of the app.  By switching to Microsoft Edge Chromium or another modern browser, the user will not see this message.
