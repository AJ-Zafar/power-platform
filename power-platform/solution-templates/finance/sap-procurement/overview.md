# SAP procurement solution template for Power Platform

SAP enterprise resource planning (ERP) is a centralized system of record that facilitates the management of data and business processes between departments in an organization. Microsoft Power Platform can help you transform the way you view and work with your SAP data. Enhanced functionalities in the on-premises data gateway and the [SAP ERP connector](/connectors/saperp/) make it easier for you to get started with and manage your SAP integration with Power Platform.

The SAP procurement template solution accelerates the integration of data between SAP and Power Platform to drive efficiencies in your procure-to-pay processes. The solution template contains the building blocks needed to streamline all the SAP screens and attributes related to a core process into one simple screen in Power Apps, with further automation of processes behind the scenes using Power Automate flows. With little to no training, procurement team members can manage SAP data in less time, reduce inefficiencies in current manual processes, and avoid data entry mistakes.

Additionally, since the Power Platform can connect multiple business systems, your SAP data can be integrated into more connected processes that drive better user experiences and efficiencies.

The solution template's starter apps, flows, and other components are ready for you to extend and customize to meet your organization's unique needs. It consists of the following layered solutions:

- **SAP Base** contains base components used by the SAP procurement solution template and future SAP solution templates.
- **SAP Procurement** contains components that help transform your procure-to-pay business processes connected to SAP.
