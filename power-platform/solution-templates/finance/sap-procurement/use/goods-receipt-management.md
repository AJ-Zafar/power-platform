# SAP Goods Receipt Management app

The SAP Goods Receipt Management application allows you to do several functions in SAP quicker and easier than using SAPGui.  You can search for and view an existing goods receipt document and receive goods against a purchase order.

## View a goods receipt

There are three options for viewing a goods receipt:

- You can select a recent goods receipt that you have interacted with.
- You can type in the goods receipt number, if you know it.
- You can search for a goods receipt based on vendor, purchase order, and date range.

## Select a goods receipt

From the _Select recent goods receipt_ drop down list, you can see a list of previous goods receipts that you have interacted with. You can choose one from the list, and it will load the data for that goods receipt.
