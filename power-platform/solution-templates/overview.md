# What are solution templates for Power Platform?

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

Solution templates for Power Platform are solutions built on [Microsoft Power Platform](/power-platform/). The templates are designed drive productivity and operational efficiencies within specific lines of business or enterprise-wide. Aligned to specific use cases and outcomes, they accelerate time to value by digitizing new processes or extending upon existing major technology investments such as an enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), or human capital management (HCM) systems.

Power Platform solution templates require premium licensing and are designed to be installed and extended upon locally by a centralized team. You can organize an internal information technology (IT) and  business operations team or select an external partner team to implement the Power Platform template solution project.
