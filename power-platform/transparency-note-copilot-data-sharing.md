# Transparency note for data sharing for Copilot AI features in Microsoft Power Platform

This transparency note describes information related to data sharing for Copilot AI features in Power Platform and how Microsoft responsibly uses your data.

## What is data sharing for Copilot AI features?  

Microsoft is constantly working to improve the quality of the new AI-powered Copilot features to generate outcomes with better accuracy. One of the important ways to improve Copilot features is to better understand users’ inputs to the Copilot features and related outputs. This setting allows Microsoft to capture and manually review users’ natural language inputs, outputs, and related telemetry to build, improve, and/or validate Microsoft’s product.  

## What are the benefits of opting in?  

Sharing your data can benefit you in two ways:  

- Existing Copilot AI features will be more effective for you as the models learn from and adapt to aggregate patterns observed in your data.  

- We can derive new models that power new AI features in the product. You can use these AI features to create more effective flows and increase their productivity.

## How do I opt out?

By default, the data sharing option is disabled for you. After you opt-in, you can opt out any time by going to the **Settings** > **Tenant Settings** page in the Power Platform admin center and turning off **Data sharing for Copilot AI features** > **Enable Data Sharing** toggle. MOre information: [Tenant settings](admin/tenant-settings.md)

## What happens when I opt out?

You own your data. Microsoft will use your data only to provide the services we've agreed upon and for the purposes that are compatible with providing those services. Your data remains yours and we don't share it. If you leave this program, all your data is deleted within 30 days of opting out.

## Who has access to my data?

Access to customer data is strictly controlled. Your data can be viewed only by those Microsoft employees who must view your data and have authorized access.  

## What about data privacy?

All data is handled as per the Copilot data security and privacy guidelines explained in [Transparency note for Copilot data security and privacy in Microsoft Power Platform](transparency-note-copilot-data-security-privacy.md).

## What about Customer Lockbox?

[Customer Lockbox](admin/about-lockbox.md) won't apply to the access and manual review of customer data shared using this setting. Customer Lockbox will remain enabled for all in-scope data.


## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the system?

Your data can only be accessed by Mocrosoft personnel using JIT access via SAW machines. Your data is stored in your geographic data boundaries with a 30-day retention policy.
