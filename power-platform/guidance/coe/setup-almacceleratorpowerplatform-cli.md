# Set up ALM Accelerator for Power Platform components (preview)

> [!NOTE]
> ALM Accelerator for Power Platform (AA4PP) is currently in public preview. Go to [Issues currently tagged as vnext](https://github.com/microsoft/coe-starter-kit/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aalm-accelerator+label%3Avnext) for the roadmap to be completed prior to general availability. While the tool is in public preview, there will be breaking changes and frequent updates to address feedback from preview members. Additionally, the public preview is reliant on the experimental [Power Apps Source File Pack and Unpack Utility](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Language-Tooling) that is being developed separately from AA4PP.

The ALM Accelerator components enable makers to apply source control strategies using DevOps and use automated builds and deployment of solutions to their environments without the need for manual intervention by the maker, administrator, developer, or tester. In addition, the ALM Accelerator helps makers work without intimate knowledge of the downstream technologies and switch quickly from developing solutions to source controlling the solution and ultimately pushing their apps to other environments with as few interruptions to their work as possible.

The ALM Accelerator components solution doesn't have a dependency on other components of the CoE Starter Kit. It can be used independently.
