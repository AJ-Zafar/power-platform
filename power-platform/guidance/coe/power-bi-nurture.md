# Nurture in the CoE Power BI dashboard

As you establish your Center of Excellence (CoE), a significant part of your activity will be nurturing your maker community, enabling them to follow best practices and working together with them to identify whether they need more support.

The **Nurture** section helps you find your "star" app and flow makers and see what connectors they're using, where they're based (department/city/country), and how they're adopting Microsoft Power Platform.

## Makers

The **Maker** page, at one glance, helps you see your top makers, how many apps and flows those makers have created, and your top active departments and where your makers are based.

### Desktop flows usage

The **desktop flow usage** page provides an overview of UI-based RPA flow runs in your environment:

- Number of runs per date and desktop flow type
- Total number of runs
- Last run date and status

Filters on this page can help you narrow down this view by desktop flow type, run status, maker, and environment.
