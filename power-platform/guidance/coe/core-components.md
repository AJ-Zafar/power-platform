# Use core components

These components provide the core to get started with setting up a Center of Excellence (CoE). They sync all your resources into entities and build admin apps on top of that to help you get more visibility of the apps, flows, and makers in your environment. Additionally, apps like the DLP Editor and Set App Permissions help with daily admin tasks. The Core Components solution contains assets relevant only to admins. More information: [Set up core components](setup-core-components.md)

> [!NOTE]
> To easily explore and manage data stored in CDS, we recommend you install the [Microsoft PowerApps Office Add-in](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/WA104380330?tab=Overview).<br><br>
> More information about its usage can be found in the following blog post. [Working with data in the Common Data Service for Apps using the Excel Add-in!](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/cds-for-apps-excel-importexport/).

## Flows

### Admin \| Sync Template v2

Runs on a daily schedule, retrieves the environments in your tenant using [List Environments as Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/powerplatformforadmins/#list-environments-as-admin) and creates or updates a record per environment in the Environment CDS entity.

Running this flow will also trigger the rest of the sync flows indirectly by updating the environment records in the Common Data Service instance you instantiated.

### Admin \| Sync Template v2 (Apps)

Runs when an environment is created or modified, and gets app information using [Get Apps as Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/powerappsforadmins/#get-apps-as-admin), information is then created or updated in the PowerApps App entity.

### Admin \| Sync Template v2 (Flows)

Runs when an environment is created or modified, and gets flow information using [List Flows as Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/flowmanagement/#list-flows-as-admin). Also updates the record if flows are deleted.

### Admin \| Sync Template v2 (Flow Action Details)

Runs once daily on a schedule, and gets the actions and triggers for all flows.

> [!WARNING]
> This flow uses [Get Flow as Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/flowmanagement/#get-flow-as-admin) for every indivdual flow in your tenant, to get action and trigger details. Thus, it can be a very time and resource consuming flow to run.
Turning this flow on is optional, and only recommended if you are looking to perform action-level reporting or analysis, such as reporting on who is using the Send Email action of the Office 365 Outlook connector.

### Admin \| Sync Template v2 (Connectors)

Runs once daily on a schedule, and gets connector information using [Get Connectors](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/powerappsforappmakers/#get-connectors), information such as the connector name, publisher and tier are stored.

### Admin \| Sync Template v2 (Custom Connector)

Runs when an environment is created or modified, and gets custom connector information using [Get Custom Connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/powerappsforadmins/#get-custom-connectors-as-admin), information such as the name, endpoint and created by/on are stored.

### Admin \| Sync Template v2 (Model Driven Apps)

Runs when an environment is created or modified, and gets model-driven app information. This information is retrieved from underlying CDS entities and requires the user running the flow to have System Administrator privileges to the environment.

### Admin \| Sync Template v2 (Power Apps User Shared With))

Runs when a PowerApps App record (canvas app) is created or modified, and gets who the app is shared with using [Get App Role Assignments as Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/powerappsforadmins/#get-app-role-assignments-as-admin).

### Admin \| Sync Template v2 (PVA)

Runs when an environment is created or updated, and retrieves Power Virtual Agent (bot) information. This information is retrieved from underlying CDS entities and requires the user running the flow to have System Administrator privileges to the environment.

Turning this flow is optional; and only recommended if you are using Power Virtual Agents in your tenant and interested in getting tenant wide overview.

### Admin \| Sync Template v2 (Sync Flow Errors)

Runs on a schedule, and sends an email to the admin about environments that failed to sync (with a link to the flow instance).

## Apps

### DLP Editor

Canvas app that reads and updates data loss prevention (DLP) policies while showing a list of apps that are affected by the policy configurations.

Use this app to:

- Make changes to DLP policies.
- See what impact each change will have.
- Mitigate the risk of DLP changes' breaking a flow or an app by contacting makers.

More information: [Introduction to data groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/introduction-to-data-groups)

**Permission**: Intended to be used only by admins: Power Platform Service Admin or Global Admin permission required. Share with your CoE admins.

### DLP Customizer

Canvas app you can use to add custom connectors to the Business Data Group of a DLP policy, or to enable HTTP connectors to a DLP policy.

Use this app to:

- Set a new app owner
- Add new viewers and editors
- Remove app permissions
- Change app permissions from Editors to Viewers or Viewers to Editors

It will also let you find apps that have been orphaned by the owner having left your organization, and clean them up.

### Set Flow Permissions

Similar to the Set App Permissions app, this canvas app lets an admin discover flows by flow name, environment, or owner name.

Use this app to:

- Add new viewers and editors
- Remove flow permissions

Ownership cannot be changed for flows.

The app will also let you find flows that have been orphaned by the owner having left your organization, and clean them up.

More information: [Create Team Flows](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-automate/create-team-flows)

**Permission**: This app is intended to be used only by admins: Power Platform Service Admin or Global Admin permission required. Share with your CoE admins.

### Power Platform Admin View

A model-driven app that provides an interface used to browse items in Common Data Service custom entities. It provides access to views and forms for the custom entities in the solution.

Use this app to:

- Get a quick overview of resources in your tenant
- Learn about your makers, connectors, apps and flows
- Find out who apps are shared with
- Add additional information, such as notes and risk assessments, to your resources
- Complete [App Audits](example-processes.md)

![Power Platform Admin View model-driven app](media/coe-mda1.png "Power Platform Admin View model-driven app")

At a quick glance, this app also allows you to view who an app is shared with, what roles (edit or view) the users have and - for groups - what the group size is.

## Power BI Report

Provides a holistic view with visualizations and insights of data in the Common Data Service entities: Environments, Power Apps Apps, Flows, Connectors, Connection References, Makers, and Audit Logs.

Follow the [setup instructions](setup-powerbi.md) to set up the Power BI dashboard. Learn how to use it in [Learn about the CoE dashboard](power-bi.md).
