# Setup the Power Platform administration planning component

This article will help you set up the Power Platform Administration Planning component of the Center of Excellence (CoE) Starter Kit.

If your organization is just getting started, or already using Power Platform, defining administrative tasks and analyzing where you spend time administrating the platform enables you to:

- Plan your team structure.
- Expose opportunities for automation and innovation.

The Power Platform Administration Planning component contains the following:

- Dataverse table
- Model driven app
- Sample data import flow
- Power BI Dashboard

Install the solution following the steps below:

## Import the core components solution

1. Download the CoE Starter Kit compressed file ([aka.ms/CoeStarterKitDownload](https://aka.ms/CoeStarterKitDownload)).

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    > **Extract the zip file** after downloading and before moving on to the next step. The CoE Starter Kit compressed file contains all solution components in addition to the nonâ€“solution-aware components that make up the CoE Starter Kit.

1. Import the solution:
    1. If you're [installing to a production environment](faq.md#installing-a-solution-in-a-production-environment), use the CenterOfExcellenceCoreComponents_x_x_x_xx_managed.zip solution file from the download.

1. Update environment variable values by using the [relevant information](#gather-environment-variable-values). The environment variables are used to store application and flow configuration data with data specific to your organization or environment. This means that you only have to set the value once per environment and it will be used in all necessary flows and apps in that environment. All the flows in the solution depend on all environment variables' being configured.

The import can take up to 15 minutes to be completed.

>[!NOTE]
>The next steps walk you through turning on the Import-SampleTaskData cloud flow.

## Importing sample admin task data

If you are getting started or simply want to populate the solution with common administrative tasks, then you should import data from the sample admin tasks spreadsheet.

### Extending the Power Platform administration planning solution

The Power Platform administration planning solution is managed.  This means, making changes will create an unmanaged layer.  The steps outlined here walk through creating an unmanaged solution that contains your configuration changes.

1. Create a solution. In solution explorer select **'+ New solution'**
1. Complete the **Display name** and **Name** fields, then select a **Publisher** (or create one)
1. When the solution has been created, open it, then select **'Cloud flows'** > **Add existing** > **Automation** > **Cloud flow** > Select the **Import-SampleTaskData** Cloud flow > **Add**
1. Select *...* > **Edit** > **Edit**
1. Expand the second action, labeled **'List rows present in a table'** and update the following parameters:
    1. Location: the root location that you have copied the 'Sample-task-data.xlsx' spreadsheet to (e.g. SharePoint Site URL, OneDrive for Business')
    1. Document library: the document library that you copied the 'Sample-task-data.xlsx' file to
    1. File: Select the file
    1. Table: Set to Table1
  1. Select **Save**

1. Turn on the cloud flow
1. Run the cloud flow

Once the cloud flow has completed successfully, check that the sample data is present.

#### Check sample data

If the cloud flow successfully completes, all sample tasks should be present in the Dataverse table named 'Admin tasks'. Launch the Admin tasks app to check tasks were successfully imported. When you've successfully launched the app, you should see the sample admin tasks:

![Launch the admin tasks app](media/Admin-task-app.png "Launch the Admin tasks app")

By default, all tasks are set as 'Active'

## Admin tasks - model driven app

Launch the Admin tasks app to start adding your own, or configuring tasks that you imported via the Sample-task-data.xlsx spreadsheet.

### Configuring and creating tasks

The dashboard and insights this solution provides derive from admin task data which you interact with via the Admin tasks app.

The following table illustrates the purpose for each column:

|Column   |Type | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---|
|Name   | Text | Display name of task, e.g. 'Create an environment'  |
|Task description| Text | Brief description of the task. |
|Task documentation link | URL | Url link to documentation. |
|Active task | Choice | 'Yes'/ 'No' - Active tasks are tasks that you perform as an organization. |
| Outsourced task | Choice | 'Yes' / 'No' - Is the task outsourced? |
| Automation | Choice | 'Yes' / 'No' - Is the task automated? |
| Owner | User | User that created the record. |
| Frequency | Choice | Choice of daily, weekly, monthly, ad-hoc, etc. | 
| Anticipated task iterations | Number | How many times do you believe the task will be performed in one year? **This column is managed by a business rule calculating the number of iterations for you, unless you select 'Ad-hoc'**|
| Duration | Number | How many minutes will the task take to complete? |
| Experience required | Choice | What level of experience is required to complete the task. |
| Core admin persona | Choice | Who in the core team will primarily perform the task (e.g. Environment Admin, Product Owner, etc) |
| Peripheral admin persona | Choice | Who else is required to complete the task (e.g. Azure AD Administrator, SharePoint Administrator, etc) |
| Primary task category | Choice | Select a category that the task predominantly fits into (e.g. reporting, security, etc) |
| Secondary task category | Choice | Select a second category that the task predominantly fits into (e.g. Capacity, Performance, etc)  |
| Product or service | Choice | Select the Power Platform Product or service |

## Setup the Power BI dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides visualizations and insights into what your administration story looks like based on your task metadata. Providing insights into: your team structure, automation and outsourcing impact, proactive/ reactive task balance, persona and experience requirements.
