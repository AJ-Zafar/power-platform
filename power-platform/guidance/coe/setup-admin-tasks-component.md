# Setup the Power Platform administration planning component

This article will help you set up the Power Platform Administration Planning component of the Center of Excellence (CoE) Starter Kit.

If your organization is just getting started, or already using Power Platform, defining administrative tasks and analyzing where you spend time administrating the platform enables you to:

- Plan your team structure.
- Expose opportunities for automation and innovation.

The Power Platform Administration Planning component contains:

- Dataverse table
- Model driven app
- Sample data import flow
- Power BI Dashboard

Install the solution following the steps below:

## Import the Power Platform Administration Planning component solution

1. Download the CoE Starter Kit compressed file ([aka.ms/CoeStarterKitDownload](https://aka.ms/CoeStarterKitDownload)).

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    > **Extract the zip file** after downloading and before moving on to the next step. The CoE Starter Kit compressed file contains all solution components in addition to the nonâ€“solution-aware components that make up the CoE Starter Kit.

1. Import the solution:
    1. If you're [installing to a production environment](faq.md#installing-a-solution-in-a-production-environment), use the admintaskanalysis_core_x_x_x_xx_managed.zip solution file from the download.

The import can take up to 15 minutes to be completed.

>[!NOTE]
>The next steps are optional, if you want to import sample task data (recommended).

## Importing sample admin task data

If you're getting started or want to populate the solution with common administrative tasks, then import data from the sample admin tasks spreadsheet.

1. Launch the 'admin tasks' app
1. From the command bar, select '...' > 'Import from Excel'
1. Select 'Choose File'
1. Navigate to the location where you saved the 'Sample-task-data.xlsx' file > 'Open'
1. Select 'Next' > 'Review mapping'

1. Click 'Finish'

An import job has been created at this point, you can track progress by selecting the button labeled 'Track Progress'.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Power Platform administration, importing all sample columns data can be helpful.  You should review the duration and anticipated number of iterations columns to reflect your planning.

#### Check sample data

If the import job successfully completes, all sample tasks should be present in the Dataverse table named 'Admin tasks'. Launch the Admin tasks app to check tasks were successfully imported. When you've successfully launched the app, you should see the sample admin tasks:

![Launch the admin tasks app](media/Admin-task-app.png "Launch the Admin tasks app")

By default, all tasks are set as 'Active'

## Admin tasks - model driven app

Launch the Admin tasks app to start adding your own, or configuring tasks that you imported via the Sample-task-data.xlsx spreadsheet.

### Configuring and creating tasks

The dashboard and insights this solution provides derive from admin task data that you interact with via the Admin tasks app.

The following table illustrates the purpose for each column:

|Column   |Type | Purpose |

1. In Power BI Desktop, open the .pbit file, which can be found in the CoE Starter Kit you downloaded from [aka.ms/CoEStarterKitDownload](https://aka.ms/CoEStarterKitDownload). The template file title is **PowerPlatformAdminPlanner.pbit**

1. Enter the URL of your environment instance where you imported the solution.
