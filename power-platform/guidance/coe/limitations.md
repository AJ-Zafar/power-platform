# Limitations

There is no "one size fits all" solution for a Center of Excellence (CoE). Some companies will want a very restrictive set of rules on their organization in hopes of mitigating the unknown, while others will want to let users personally explore without limitations. Because of this, the CoE Starter Kit doesn't come equipped with a set of design patterns for everyone. For example, there are no components that are configured to automatically delete resources, because we didn't want to provide a tool that might unintentionally disrupt a business when installed. Therefore, if your organization wants a more restrictive implementation, it must be implemented in addition to these tools.

In addition to this high-level warning, the following notes pertain to limitations on some components.

## Timeouts in the Admin | Sync Template V2

The Common Data Service connector might experience some throttling limits if the tenant has a lot of resources. If you see 429 errors in the flow run history occurring in the later runs, you can try the following resolution steps:

1. **Configure retry policy**
    1. Open **Admin \| Sync Template v2**, and then select **Edit**.
    1. Expand the step: **Get Environments and store them in the CoE Common Data Service Entity**.
    1. Expand the step: **Apply to each Environment**
    1. Go to the **Settings** pane for each call to Common Data Service, and configure the timeout/retry settings. <br> ![Configure retry policy](media/coe72.png "Configure the retry policy")

1. **Configure concurrency in Foreach**<br>
    Reduce concurrency in Foreach loops to reduce simultaneous calls:
    1. Open **Admin \| Sync Template v2**, and then select **Edit**.
    1. Expand the step: **Get Environments and store them in the CoE Common Data Service Entity**.
    1. Go to Settings for the **Apply to each Environment** step. <br>![Configure concurrency in Foreach](media/coe73.png "Configure concurrency in Foreach")
    1. Reduce the **Degree of Parallelism** using the slider. The default value is 50 - reducing the parallelism here will increase the runtime of the flow, so we suggest gradually lowering the number.

## DLP editor

- The Environments call returns only the first 2,000 environments.
- The tool can't write back Environment-type policies.

## Government community cloud (GCC) environments

- The CoE Starter Kit is available for government cloud (GCC) environments; however the custom connector to connect to Office 365 Audit Logs isn't available for GCC environments yet.
