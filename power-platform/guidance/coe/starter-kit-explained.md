# CoE Starter Kit modules

The Center of Excellence (CoE) Starter Kit is shipped in multiple components:

- **Center of Excellence – core components**  

    These components provide what you need to get started with setting up a CoE. They sync all your resources into tables and build admin apps on top of that to help you get more visibility of the apps, flows, and makers that exist in your environment. Additionally, apps like DLP Editor and Set App Permissions help with daily admin tasks.  

    The CoE core components solution contains assets that are only relevant to admins. More information: [Set up core components](setup-core-components.md) and [Use core components](core-components.md)

- **Center of Excellence – governance components**  

    After you've become familiar with your environment and resources, you might start thinking about audit and compliance processes for your apps. You might want to gather additional information about your apps from your makers, or audit specific connectors or app usage. The apps and flows that are part of this solution help you get started.  

    The governance components solution contains assets that are relevant to admins and makers. More information: [Set up governance components](setup-governance-components.md) and [Use governance components](governance-components.md)

- **Center of Excellence – nurture components**  

    An essential part of establishing a CoE is nurturing your makers and creating an internal community. You'll want to share best practices and templates, and onboard new makers. The assets that are part of this solution can help develop a strategy for this motion.  

    The nurture components solution contains assets that are relevant to everyone in the organization: admins, makers, and users of apps and flows. More information: [Set up nurture components](setup-nurture-components.md) and [Use nurture components](nurture-components.md)

- **Center of Excellence – theming components**  

    A frequent ask from organizations in which makers create canvas apps is the ability to apply themes&mdash;specifically, the ability to create apps that match the organizational brand. The assets in this solution will help you create, manage, and share themes.

    The theming components solution contains assets that are relevant to makers and designers. More information: [Set up theming components](setup-theming.md) and [Use theming components](theming-components.md)

- **Center of Excellence – PowerOps components**  

    The Power Platform ALM Starter Kit is intended to provide Power Platform makers guidance on creating healthy Application Lifecycle Management practices for their solutions as part of their overall DevOps strategy. The tools provided in the starter kit are intended for use by any level of maker's experience and background with ALM. The PowerOps components implement ALM using GitHub.

    The PowerOps components solution contains assets that are relevant to makers and admins. More information: [Set up PowerOps components](setup-powerops.md) and [Use PowerOps components](powerops-components.md)

We recommend becoming familiar with the CoE core components solution before you add governance, nurture, or theming components.
