# CoE Starter Kit modules

The Center of Excellence (CoE) Starter Kit is shipped in multiple modules:

-  **Center of Excellence – Core Components**  

    These components provide what you need to get started with setting up a CoE. They sync all your resources into entities and build admin apps on top of that to help you get more visibility of the apps, flows, and makers that exist in your environment. Additionally, apps like the DLP Editor and Set New App Owner help with daily admin tasks.  

    The CoE Core Components solution contains assets that are only relevant to admins. More information: [Set up core components](setup-core-components.md) and [Use core components](core-components.md)

-  **Center of Excellence – Governance Components**  

    After you've become familiar with your environment and resources, you might start thinking about audit and compliance processes for your apps. You might want to gather additional information about your apps from your makers, or audit specific connectors or app usage. The apps and flows that are part of this solution help you get started.  

    The Governance Components solution contains assets that are relevant to admins and makers. More information: [Set up governance components](setup-governance-components.md) and [Use governance components](governance-components.md)

-  **Center of Excellence – Nurture Components**  

    An essential part of establishing a CoE is nurturing your makers and creating an internal community. You'll want to share best practices and templates, and onboard new makers. The assets that are part of this solution can help develop a strategy for this motion.  

    The Nurture Components solution contains assets that are relevant to everyone in the organization: admins, makers, and users of apps and flows. More information: [Set up nurture components](setup-nurture-components.md) and [Use nurture components](nurture-components.md)

We recommend becoming familiar with the Center of Excellence Core Components solution before adding governance and nurture components.
