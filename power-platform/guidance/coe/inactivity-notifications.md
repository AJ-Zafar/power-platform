# CoE Starter Kit - Inactivity notifications

Not every app or cloud flow in your tenant will be in use. Inactive apps and flows reduce the overall agility of your Center of Excellence. Changes, for example, an impact analysis on DLP policy change can take longer to complete.  

The inactivity notifications process in the CoE Starter Kit assists by communicating with owners of inactive apps and cloud flows to establish if they're still required.
