# Released version Core Components 1.68

## Introduction

Version 1.68 for the CoE Starter Kit Core Components is now available. This article describes the updates, including the new features and the fixes to existing functionality, included in this release. This version was first made available on September 18, 2020.

## Entity changes

Entities **RPA** and **RPA Session** have been added to support inventory and analytics for Ui Flows.
Connection References have been added to the solution to support the new modern import solution experience. All flows have been updated to use connection references, rather than connections.

## Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI Dashboard has been updated to show Ui Flow inventory and run details.

## Custom Connector

To help with the setup, the custom connector used in the [Audit Log components](../collect-audit-data.md) has been removed from the Audit Log solution and added to this solution.
