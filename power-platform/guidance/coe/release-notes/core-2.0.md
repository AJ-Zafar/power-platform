# Released version Core Components 2.0

Version 2.0 for the CoE Starter Kit Core Components is now available. This article describes the updates, including the new features and the fixes to existing functionality, included in this release. This version was first made available on April 8, 2021.

## Capacity and Add Ons

Environment capacity and add-ons are now stored and can be reported on. New tables (Environment Capacity, Environment Add Ons) have been added to store this information. The Power Platform Admin View model-driven app has been updated to view this information. The Admin | Sync Template v3 flow has been updated to retrieve and save this information. The Admin | Capacity Alert flow has been added to alert the admin of capacities over or close to their approved capacity.

## Moving components from Nurture

Admin | Welcome email (flow) and App catalog (canvas app) have been moved from Nurture components to Core components in an effort to allow Nurture components to be used standalone.

## Bug fixes

Bug fixes have been made to the Sync Flows.
