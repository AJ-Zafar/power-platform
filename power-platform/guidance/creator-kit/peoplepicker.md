## Examples 

Following are the examples on how to use the `PeoplePicker` component. Note that `PeoplePicker` completely supports other sources from where the input collection can be retrieved.

### Office 365 Users Connector

1. Add the Office 365 Users connector as a data source.

1. Assign the below Power Fx formula to the **On Search** property of the control to create a collection called `UserCollection`.

    ```powerapps-dot
    ClearCollect(
        UserCollection,
        AddColumns(
            Office365Users.SearchUser(
                {
                    searchTerm: Self.SearchText,
                    top: 500
                }
            ),
            "SuggestionImgUrl",
            Substitute(
                JSON(
                    Office365Users.UserPhotoV2(Id),
                    JSONFormat.IncludeBinaryData
                ),
                """",
                ""
            ),
            "SuggestionKey", Mail, 
            "SuggestionName", DisplayName,
            "SuggestionRole", JobTitle
        )
    )
    ```

1. Set the `Suggestions_Items` property to `UserCollection`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The above formula includes a consecutive request to get UserPhoto, which increases loading time. If you do not need photos and want to decrease search time, use the following formula in the `Suggestions_Items` property of the control instead of `UserCollection`: <br> 
    ```
    AddColumns(
        Office365Users.SearchUser({ searchTerm: Self.SearchText, top: 500 }),
        "SuggestionKey", Mail, 
        "SuggestionName", DisplayName,
        "SuggestionRole", JobTitle
    )
    ```

At this point the control is functioning and selected members can be obtained from the `SelectedPeople` property.

```powerapps-dot
PeoplePicker1.SelectedPeople
```

### With Dataverse tables - AAD Users or Users

Step 1) Setup the `Suggestions_Items` Property by specifying the below code snippet.

Add Users or specific users(using below code) from table to the items collection(under `Suggestions_Items` peroperty) of `PeoplePicker`.

#### `AAD Users` table

```powerapps-dot
Search('AAD Users', Self.SearchText,"displayname" ,"mail")
```

#### `Users` table

```powerapps-dot
Search('Users', Self.SearchText,"fullname","internalemailaddress")
```

Step 2) Map the Columns according your need. Below is an example of Column-Property Mapping

|Property Name|AADUser Table Column|User Table Column|
|--|--|--|
|SuggestionKey|"mail"|"internalemailaddress"|
|SuggestionName|"displayname"|"fullname"|
|SuggestionRole|"jobtitle"|"jobtitle"|

At this point, the people picker should be working and the selected members can be obtained from SelectedPeople Property.

```powerapps-dot
PeoplePicker1.SelectedPeople
```

### Event Properties

- **InputEvent** - An event to send to the control. E.g. `SetFocus`. See below.

### Setting Focus on the control

When a new dialog is shown, and the default focus should be on the control, an explicit set focus will be needed.

To make calls to the input event, you can set a context variable that is bound to the Input Event property to a string that starts with `SetFocus` and followed by a random element to ensure that the app detects it as a change.
