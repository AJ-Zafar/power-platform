# Use the Creator Kit

Once the kit has been [installed](setup.md), understand how to use the components to quickly start building apps.

The Creator Kit is shipped with:
- Multiple [components](creator-kit/components.md)
- Reference app to interactively learn
- Templates to quickly start building apps

## Building blocks

### Templates
These app templates provide what you need to get started creating a responsive Fluent UI based app. They come with the custom components pre-loaded and 

#### Canvas Template
Make a copy of this app when creating a new [canvas app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/getting-started) for a project or proof-of-concept that require the components in the kit.

#### Custom Page Template
Make a copy of this page when creating a new custom page for a [converged app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-app-page-overview).

### Canvas Components
These components are defined in the component library called "Power CAT Component Library", and are implemented with [Canvas app custom components](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/create-component).

### Code Components
Implemented with [Power Apps component framework (PCF)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/developer/component-framework/custom-controls-overview), which are defined as individual custom controls in the solution.

### Reference App
Use the reference app to interactively learn how each component is implemented. Edit the app, use the components in play mode, and observe how the property values are reflected in the real-time experience.
