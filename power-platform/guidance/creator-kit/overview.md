The Creator Kit helps you create Power Apps experiences on the web and mobile platforms with easy-to-use sample controls and components. The kit contains a component library, several commonly used [Power Apps component framework controls](/power-apps/developer/component-framework/overview), and other utilities that increase developer productivity. 

All controls and components included in the kit use the [Fluent UI](https://developer.microsoft.com/fluentui#/) framework to help you easily create consistent, beautiful, and effective user experiences for custom business applications.
