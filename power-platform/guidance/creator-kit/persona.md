## Description

A persona is a visual representation of a person across products, typically showcasing the image that person has chosen to upload themselves. The control can also be used to show that person's online status.

The complete control includes an individual's avatar (an uploaded image or a composition of the personâ€™s initials on a background color), their name or identification, and online status.

The persona control is used in the [PeoplePicker](./peoplepicker.md) and [Facepile](./facepile.md) controls.

This code component provides a wrapper around the [Fluent UI Persona](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/controls/web/Persona) control for use in canvas & custom pages. See component documentation for best practices.
