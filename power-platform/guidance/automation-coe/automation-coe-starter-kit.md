# Microsoft Power Platform Automation CoE starter kit (preview)

[This topic is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

Microsoft Power Platform Automation CoE starter kit is designed to help organizations manage, govern, and scale automation platform adoption based on industry best practices. The toolkit is a collection of components and tools based on holistic enterprise automation techniques (HEAT).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This is a preview feature.
> - Preview features aren’t meant for production use and may have restricted functionality. These features are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback
> - This feature is being gradually rolled out across regions and might not be available yet in your region.

We are pleased to announce a limited public preview of the toolkit. We are actively looking to work closely with customers to learn and improve the product. If you're interested in joining the limited preview, please [fill out the Automation CoE Starter Kit Preview form](https://aka.ms/autocoestarterkitpreview).

This toolkit is for organizations that have an existing Automation CoE for robotic process automation (RPA) and other hyperautomation scenarios or are looking to set up an RPA or Automation CoE for Microsoft Power Platform. The toolkit can be used by various stakeholders to automate the enterprise rollout of Microsoft Power Automate and manage the entire lifecycle of an automation project.

The key components of the Automation CoE starter kit are:

- Microsoft Power Platform solutions for syncing data in near-real-time for ROI and SLA.
- Apps for CoEs and makers to manage automation development projects and deployments.
- A Power BI dashboard for makers, executive sponsors, and admins to monitor the health and business status of the automation program and projects.

## Support
Although the underlying features and components used to build the Automation Center of Excellence (CoE) starter kit (such as Azure services, Dataverse, admin APIs, and Power Automate flows) are fully supported, the kit itself represents sample implementations of these features. Our customers and community can use and customize these features to implement admin and governance capabilities in their organizations.
