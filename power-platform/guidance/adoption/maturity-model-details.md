# Power Platform Adoption Maturity Model: Detailed capabilities

The goal of the Adoption Maturity Model is to help organizations and their partners to think through how they can improve their capabilities and decide which capabilities matter most to them. Each stage describes the states of individual disciplines such as Strategy & Vision, Administration, Governance, etc. The purpose of the model is to help organizations understand their capabilities along multiple dimensions on a clearly defined scale, decide which level they would like to achieve for each dimension and in what time frame, and improve their capabilities in tangible ways by progressing to the next level.

Find below detailed characteristics and capabilities of an organization in each stage:
