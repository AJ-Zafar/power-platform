# Provide internal training events

Microsoft offers a variety of hands-on lab content. These offerings include: App in an Hour, App in a Day, and Power Virtual Agents in a Day, and Admin in a Day. The materials are available to [download](https://aka.ms/powerplatformlabs) and [App in a Day events](https://aka.ms/aiadevent) specifically hosted both virtually and in person by Microsoft partners across the world.

Many organizations find success by attending App in a Day events. Once employees have attended one of the events, they can adapt the course materials to align with their organizations. Everyone in your organization is an expert in something. Teaching them to build Power Apps helps them harness that into solutions that benefit the organization.

## Running App in a Day internally

The App in a day training guides employees through the core features and capabilities of the Microsoft Power Platform. It can be used by everyone in the organization to get them thinking about how this technology can make them more successful. Download the latest version of the [App in a Day material](https://aka.ms/appinaday) to get started.

Below are a few tips for running the training internally:

- Create a dedicated [environment](../../admin/create-environment.md) for training purposes. Ensure attendees have the right license and access to the environment before the event. Ask attendees to sign up for a premium trial, or assign them a premium license in the Microsoft 365 Admin portal.
- Get familiar with the course material. Make sure you have a few facilitators ready on the day. They can help attendees 1:1 if they're stuck.
- Prepare a short intro presentation that explains the purpose of Microsoft Power Platform. Share the goals for Power Apps in your organization. If you have already created successful apps in your organization, show them during the intro so that attendees understand what Power Apps can be used for.
- Run a trial event for 10 to 12 people who you're familiar with. Choose those who can provide feedback and test the logistics with you. This may be your inner circle of champions. They can also be your trial group for other events and activities you are planning.
- Set the right expectations with attendees. Make sure they know what they are registering for, what the purpose of attending is, and what they should know or do before the event.

## Lunch and Learn

Sometimes employees canâ€™t set aside a full day to learn about something new. Often it takes igniting a spark for leaders to rise up and inspire others. Hosting lunch-and-learn sessions is a great way to educate the Microsoft Power Platform community.

Lunch-and-learn sessions provide an environment for teams to share resources, guidelines, and procedures. Sessions should be fun and regular. As more employees become interested, the sessions offer a place to get more involved with. Eventually it can become a path for employees to learn about Power Apps.

Check out the [App in an Hour](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/hands-on-lab-building-a-conference-app-in-60-min/) content to get an idea of what you can achieve in a short time period.

## Q & A sessions

Existing developers typically have ongoing questions about how to build apps and flows. Through regular Q&A sessions, makers can get live help about issues that they are struggling with. By recording these sessions, others who struggle with the same things can also benefit. This way you can build a library of content available to new makers.
