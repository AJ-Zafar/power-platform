# Overview of Success Hub

Traditionally, in larger organizations, there have been central IT teams to develop and manage business applications. These IT teams were maintaining an ever-growing backlog with no way for each of the requirements to be developed. This lead to productivity loss across the organization making it necessary for sub organizations to have their own teams for their digitalization. Microsoft Power Apps and Power Platform empower individuals in the organization to develop apps for their team’s business needs and not to be blocked on a central IT team. But, with every employee developing apps on their own, there arises problems of reusability – both for the data and apps at the organization level along with support and maintenance. For organization digitalization, we need to look beyond a specific team’s needs and implement things for the organization.

In Microsoft there are multiple sub-divisions/organizations focused on specific products/services. One of them is the Business Application Group (BAG) which is focused on product development of Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Power Platform. BAG has more than 5,000 people with custom needs of its own. Success Hub is a platform enabling digitalization for BAG, whereas Microsoft IT (CSEO) plays the role of Center of Excellence enabling Power Platform governance and environment strategy for all of Microsoft.

## What is Success Hub?

Success Hub is a platform based on CDS, where teams within BAG can develop their apps and share/reuse the data from other apps and systems. There are about 35+ business apps on the platform which are developed by 20+ teams. It has enabled us to achieve the balance between agility and governance.

## Advantages of using Success Hub

Success Hub provides the following:

- Shared apps & data: Since, the data is stored in single CDS instance, many apps uses the same data for their apps. E.g., entities like Account, Contacts, Product are widely used across multiple apps. 
- Integration with other data sources: Apps do need data from other systems within Microsoft e.g., Sales data, Support data, etc. These integrations are already enabled within Success hub, for any app to use it.
- Governance for co-development: Governance model for multiple teams to co-develop at the same time on the platform.
- ALM: ALM features provided (e.g. dev environments, deployments, etc.) for teams to get started quickly.
- Compliance & Security: Success Hub platform takes care of the compliance, security, and privacy reviews on a regular basis.
- Support & Maintenance: App teams can leverage designated support and live site team and channels.

These points are covered in detail in later sections.
