# Language support
We've enabled support for more languages so that your bots can reach a much broader audience all around the world.

The current Public Preview experience of language expansion support allows bot authors to create a new bot in one of the languages listed below.

## Creating a new bot in your target language

When creating a new bot, simply go through the following steps:


1. Select Language
When you create a new bot, you select the language you want your bot to use for conversations with your users.

2. Topics in target language
Once your new bot has been created, you'll notice that your bot already has content in your target language, i.e. the System Topics as well as the template User Topics have localized content.

You can now move on to create new topics for your bot, authoring bot trigger phrases and bot messages in your target language.


3. Test in target language
When you've created your own topic in the target language, you can test the bot in the chat canvas and see how it responds to target language user input and responds in kind.
