# Language support

[!INCLUDE [](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)


You can create chatbots in Power Virtual Agents in a number of languages. This means your bots can reach a much broader audience and engage with more markets all around the world.

The current Public Preview experience of language expansion support allows bot authors to create a new bot in one of the languages listed below.

## Specify a language for your bot

You can specify the target language when you first [create a bot](authoring-first-bot.md).

**To create a new bot in your target language**


1. On the **Create a new bot** window, select **Language**.


2. Choose the language you want to use. Note that some languages are listed under **Preview**.

## Default content in the target language

Once your new bot has been created, you'll notice that it already has content in the target language, including the **System Topics** and the template **User Topics**.

![Topics in target language](media/LanguageTopics.png "Topics in target language")

You can now move on to creating new topics for your bot, authoring bot trigger phrases, and creating bot messages in your target language.


When you've created your own topic in the target language, you can test the bot in the chat canvas and see how it understands user input and responds in the target language.
