# Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[pva-rebrand](includes/pva-rebrand.md)]

You can create copilots in Microsoft Copilot Studio in many languages. Your copilots can reach a broader audience and engage with more markets around the world.

## Prerequisites

[Learn more about what you can do with Microsoft Copilot Studio](fundamentals-what-is-power-virtual-agents.md).

## Specify a language for your copilot

You specify the target language when you create a copilot in your [Copilot Studio canvas](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com ).

1. From the **Home** page, select **Create a copilot**.
1. Select a language from **What language do you want your copilot to speak?**.

## Default content in the target language

After your new copilot is created, you notice it already has content in the target language, including system topics and template user topics on the **Topics** page.

You can create new topics for your copilot, author copilot trigger phrases, and create copilot messages in your target language.

You can test the copilot in the chat pane. In chat, you see how well the copilot understands user input and how it responds in that language.

## List of supported languages

Copilot Studio supports languages in three stages. The stage indicates how well the copilot can understand user input in that language, with general availability being the strongest, followed by preview, and then experimental.

> [!NOTE]
> Support levels include your Microsoft customer service support. For example, with features in preview, you can't yet contact Microsoft for technical support with Copilot Studio. In general availability, you can contact Microsoft for Copilot Studio support.
