# Overview of Agent copilot

An Agent Copilot is a copilot that is intended to help your support agents. It will provide them with generative AI-based support content, which can will be based on content based on your company website, uploaded files, or your knowledge base sources. This copilot can be embedded in your existing Customer Engagement Hub so your agents don't have to lear a new tool in order to use the generative answers capabilities from copilot.

Leveraging your existing content from external and internal data sources, your customer support agents can quickly get the answers your customers need.
