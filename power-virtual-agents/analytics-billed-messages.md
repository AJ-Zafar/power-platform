# View billed messages

A _billed message_ is an interaction between a customer and a bot. It represents one unit of consumption. The purchase of a Power Virtual Agents license includes a specific number of billed messages. Power Virtual Agents pools this capacity across the entire tenant. 

A billed message is defined as any request or message sent to the bot that triggers an action or a response from the bot. 




## Common scenarios

## View your bot's billed messages

1. In the Power Platform Admin Center

1. Select the **Billing** tab.

By default, the page displays billed sessions for the last seven days. To change the time period shown, select a period start date and (optionally) a period end date in the calendar controls.

The Billed Session report doesn't distinguish between sessions that are included in the Power Virtual Agents for Microsoft Teams plan and sessions that aren't included. The report might show an inflated number of billed sessions.
