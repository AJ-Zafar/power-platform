# Error codes: Power Virtual Agents

You will see the following error messages as a bot response when it has encountered a problem. Your users will see a more generic message but will still include the error code. For example:
> Sorry, the bot can't talk for a while. It’s something your admin needs to address. Error code:{ErrorCode}. Conversation ID: {Conversation ID}. Time (UTC): {time}.

Errors may also appear in the [Topic Checker](authoring-topic-management.md#topic-errors) where you can easily locate and fix them.
