Generate content or extract insights  
When selecting Generate content or extract insights in the plugin selection screen, Makers enter the Prompt Builder experience providing a point and click experience to create content generation capabilities using natural language like summarizing, classifying, extracting entities, translating, assessing sentiment and much more.
 

Building a prompt is performed by following these steps:
1.	Either start with one of the existing templates or write a sentence describing what you want to achieve. For instance, summarize this text as paragraph of less than 50 words.
2.	Insert in your sentence a dynamic value for each input expected to be provided by the end user in the Copilot and required to deliver your expected behavior. In the above example, the text to be summarized is expected to be provided and is a dynamic value of the prompt.
 
3.	Text your prompt to confirm that it is behaving as expected by selecting Try out prompt and entering sample values for each dynamic value.
4.	Edit the name of your prompt to properly reflect what it is doing and select Create AI plugin.
