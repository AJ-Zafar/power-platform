# Conversational AI project best practices

Engagement Principles 
Adoption of low-code technologies like Power Virtual Agents can help customers envision and deliver quickly, with 
lower management and maintenance costs. Even with those benefits, it is beneficial to be clear on the reasons you are 
adopting this technology, and how it will show its value. 
Customers approaching a Power Virtual Agents project should align project delivery with their own company culture 
and objectives. However, there are some core principles that we see adopted again and again amongst successful PVA 
projects:

 |Many customers are surprised when their PVA bot goes live how quickly the “customer feedback flywheel” takes effect. Actionable customer feedback comes in almost instantly.Delaying for additional topics or processes means missing out on this valuable feedback. Encourage the team to see the go-live as the beginning of your project, not the finale.|One of the core value propositions of Power Virtual Agents is iteratively delivering a conversational AI experience quickly. After the go-live by a project team, who is familiar with how the bot has been developed, maintainability is key to staying agile. While the tooling can allow users to create complex conversation flows, and extensibility with Bot Framework can achieve very flexible interactions, there should be careful consideration if complexity is always necessary.|It’s very easy when implementing new technology like a chatbot, to get wrapped in the minor details of implementation. Defining what your key business goals are (e.g., deflect 30% customer queries, score above 4.0 customer satisfaction), can help keep the project moving and ensure correct feature prioritization.|
