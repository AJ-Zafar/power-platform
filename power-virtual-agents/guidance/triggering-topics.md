# Triggering topics

There are two main ways to trigger a topic: 
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * **Based on the user query** (also known as *utterance*). <br> Topic triggering based on what an end-user writes or says is also referred to as *intent recognition*. <br> The AI uses its Natural Language Understanding (NLU) model to parse the end-user utterance and finds the most relevant topic based on the configured trigger phrases that match the intent. <br> If multiple topics are found, the [Multiple Topics Matched](/power-virtual-agents/preview/authoring-system-topics#multiple-topics-matched) topic is triggered, so the that the user can select the appropriate topic from a list.
> * **By redirecting** to it from another topic, with a redirect node.

## Triggering topics based on a user qurey
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Example: The "*Store Locations*" topic gets triggered based on the user utterance and the matching **trigger phrases**.
