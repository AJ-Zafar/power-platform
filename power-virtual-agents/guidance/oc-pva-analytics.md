# Analytics considerations for Copilot Studio vs Dynamics 365 Omnichannel

Analytics is a top priority for Dynamics 365 Omnichannel and Copilot Studio customers tracking the performance of their copilots and call center agents. 
There are major efforts currently underway to improve the analytics across both these products. Gaining insights about analytics across Copilot Studio and Dynamics 365 Omnichannel can help you enhance the performance of your copilot. 

In this article, we touch on concepts that help you understand the difference between Dynamics 365 Omnichannel analytics and Copilot Studio analytics, and the purpose behind the analytics tools in each of them. These concepts can help you make informed decisions about the copilot performance for your implementation.

## Using Copilot Studio Analytics

The standard analytics tools in Coplilot Studio are focused on providing insights about topics performance during chat sessions. They don't provide end-to-end insight that includes any human-agent conversation. But, they can be used to improve the topic performance inside the copilot. 

The insights you can get from Copilot Studio analytics include metrics for questions like:

 - How engaged are users with the copilots?
 - Which topics are driving resolutions, escalations, and abandonment?

In general, Copilot Studio analytics metrics are useful to enhance the bot performance in terms of the topics. These metrics give insights about what new topics you need to create and update to achieve better resolution rates for future user queries.

## Understanding Copilot Studio analytics definitions

It's important to understand the way Copilot Studio calculates the various metrics made available to [Analyze bot performance and usage in Copilot Studio](../analytics-summary.md). These calculations are based on the copilot sessions. 

A session can be an *unbilled* or a *billed* session. A billed session is a continuous interaction between a copilot and a user to address all of userâ€™s question within a 60-minute time window.

A billed session can include multiple user authored topics and can't last longer than 60 minutes or 100 turns.

A session is interaction between a copilot and a user to address or assist a user with one query or intent (one user authored topic).

Most sessions are *engaged*, which means that a user-authored topic or an escalation was triggered. There are three possible outcomes for an engaged session:

- Resolved: End users are offered an end-of-conversation survey and either responds yes or leaves without a response.
- Escalated: End users indicate that they need a human to help resolve the issue.
- Abandoned: An engaged session that isn't resolved or escalated and is inactive after 60 minutes from the beginning of the session. An outcome of abandoned happens, for example, if the user leaves.

A topic is tied to a dialog flow built in Copilot Studio. One topic contains one dialog flow.

## Using Dynamics 365 Omnichannel chatbot analytics

The [standard bot analytics tools in Dynamics 365 Omnichannel](/dynamics365/customer-service/use/oc-bot-dashboard) are focused on providing insights about how the overall copilot deflection is performing through the conversations. These analytics are optimized to give insight into the overall interaction/conversation across both copilot and human agent.

The insights you can get from Dynamics 365 Omnichannel include:

- Bot resolution time
- Bot escalation time
- Conversation escalation

## Copilot Studio vs Omnichannel analytics comparison

Analytics calculations differ between Copilot Studio and Dynamics 365 Omnichannel for metrics with the same names, such as resolution rate, escalation rate, and abandonment rate.

For example, an ongoing interaction with a user that would be considered one conversation and one bot session in Dynamics 365 Omnichannel analytics may be counted as multiple  analytic sessions by Copilot Studio analytics. Because of these differences, resolution rates, escalation rates and abandonment rates can be different between Copilot Studio analytics and Dynamics 365 Omnichannel analytics. 

Here's an example showing the differences for analytics between the two for a single conversation:

You need to consider these key calculation differences when you consume Copilot Studio and Dynamics 365 Omnichannel analytics to determine key metrics like deflection rate, resolution rate, and so on. The general recommendation is that you rely on Dynamics 365 Omnichannel analytics to track the overall copilot deflection rate for the organization and use the Copilot Studio analytics to enhance the topic performance.
