As a bot maker, your job isn't done when you publish your Copilot for use. You'll want to know how well your bot is performing its intended duties. The comprehensive analytics in Power Virtual Agents keep your bot's key performance indicators front and center. Multiple charts show trends and usage for your bot's topics. These charts use AI to highlight the topics that have the greatest effect on your bot's performance.

The analytics section is divided into a number of pages to give you multiple ways to understand bot performance.

The following terms are used in this section.

- A _conversation_ is an ongoing interaction between a specific user, or group of users and your bot. Conversations can pause and resume later. The conversation may be one-way, either from the end user to the bot, or from the bot to the end user, but is more commonly a back-and-forth interaction between the end user and the bot.
- _Analytics sessions_ track user engagement for your bot. Analytics sessions try to capture how well your bot handles user tasks.

 [!NOTE]
Transcripts are available for download about 20 minutes after an analytic session *ends*, as conversation transcripts in Dataverse via the Power Apps portal and as session chat transcripts via the Power Virtual Agents app. It can take up to an hour after the analytic session *ends* before appearing in the analytics dashboard.
