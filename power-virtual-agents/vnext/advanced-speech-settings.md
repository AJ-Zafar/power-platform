# Select voice font for speech

[!INCLUDE [Build 2022](includes/build-22-disclaimer.md)]

You can create telephony bots with a variety of voices (called voice fonts) in Power Virtual Agents. Voice fonts give your bots personality with a variety of voices and speaking styles that you can select based on the bot's domain and context.

## Configure Speech settings

You can configure voice font settings in **Speech**.

1. In Power Virtual Agents, select the **Settings** tab on the side pane. Then select **General**.

## Speech settings

### Voice fonts

Aside from the default, there are other font options available. Select the voice font from the drop-down list that works best for your bot.

### Speaking styles

For specific voice fonts, like en-US-JennyNeural and en-US-GuyNeural, you can select a **Speaking style**. Speaking styles can be used to add more linguistic variety to your bots and tailor the speech for a specific domain.

For example, you can select **newscast** for a bot that delivers news, **chat** for a friendly chat bot, or **customerservice** for bots that handle customer service tasks. Other options add emotion to bot speech, like **excited**, or type of speech, like **whispering**.
