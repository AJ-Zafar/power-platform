# Key concepts - Configuration of Power Virtual Agents

Power Virtual Agents has a number of advanced features that let you extend the capabilities of what bot conversations can do.

These features go beyond basic topic authoring and bot conversations and allow you to create a personalized look and feel to your bot, as well as give you more flexibility in what you users can ask your bot to do. 

You can accept files for upload, sign-in to backend systems, and seamlessly integrate between virtual support conversations and support help from live agents.
