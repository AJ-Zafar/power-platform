# Power Apps portals

[Power Apps portals](/powerapps/maker/portals/overview) are external-facing websites that allow users outside their organizations to sign in with a wide variety of identities, create and view data in Microsoft Dataverse, or even browse content anonymously. You can add your bot to a portal so that visitors can interact with your bot directly on your portal's page.

## Prerequisites

- [A Power Apps portal](/powerapps/maker/portals/create-portal)
- [A Power Virtual Agents bot](/power-virtual-agents/authoring-first-bot)

## Add a bot to your Power Apps portal

Power Apps [portal Studio](/powerapps/maker/portals/portal-designer-anatomy) is a no-code experience used to create and customize portals. It contains various options to add and configure webpages, components, forms, and lists.
