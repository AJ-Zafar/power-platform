# Add a bot to Power Pages

[Power Pages](/power-pages/) are external-facing websites that allow users outside their organizations to sign in with a wide variety of identities, create and view data in Microsoft Dataverse, or even browse content anonymously. You can add your bot to a portal so that visitors can interact with your bot directly on your portal's page.

## Prerequisites

- [Learn more about what you can do with Power Virtual Agents](fundamentals-what-is-power-virtual-agents.md).
- [Create a Power Page](/powerapps/maker/portals/create-portal).
- [Create a Power Virtual Agents bot](authoring-first-bot.md).

## Add a bot to your Power Apps portal

Power Pages [design studio](/power-pages/getting-started/use-design-studio) is a no-code experience used to create and customize Power Pages. It contains various options to add and configure webpages, components, forms, and lists. You can *not* use Power Pages design studio to add a chatbot component to a web page using the components panel. You can use the alternate method provided [here](/power-pages/guidance/integrate-pva) to embed a Power Virtual Agent chatbot on a Power Pages website.
