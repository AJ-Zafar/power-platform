# Personal data requests for Copilot Studio

[!INCLUDE [gdpr-intro](~/../shared-content/shared/privacy-includes/gdpr-intro.md)]

For more information and guidance, see the [Dynamics 365 Data Subject Requests for the CDPR and CCPA](/compliance/regulatory/gdpr-dsr-dynamics365) guide.

> [!NOTE]
> Because access to your copilot is managed by your Microsoft Entra ID tenant administrator, other users with admin permissions have access to your copilot content.

## A note about requests to rectify personal data

If a data subject asks you to rectify their personal data that resides in your organization, you and your organization must determine if it's appropriate to honor the request. Rectifying the data might include taking actions such as editing, redacting, or removing personal data.

You can use Microsoft Entra to manage Copilot Studio users' identities. Enterprise customers can manage personal data rectify requests, including limited editing features, per the nature of a given Microsoft service. As a data processor, Microsoft doesn't offer the ability to correct system-generated logs because these logs reflect factual activities and constitute a historical record of events within Microsoft services.
