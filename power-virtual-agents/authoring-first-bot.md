# Create and delete Power Virtual Agents bots

Select the version of Power Virtual Agents you're using here:

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
>
> - [Power Virtual Agents web app](authoring-first-bot.md)
> - [Power Virtual Agents app in Microsoft Teams](teams/authoring-first-bot-teams.md)

To help get you started and tailor the bot to your specific needs, Power Virtual Agents lets you create a bot using built-in content building blocks containing topics, trigger phrases, and pre-authored bot conversations.

> [!WARNING]
> New bots are configured with "No authentication" and without [web channel security](configure-web-security.md), and can be accessed by anyone with a link to it. Ensure you have the right [authentication](configuration-end-user-authentication.md), [access](configuration-end-user-authentication.md), and [security](configure-web-security.md) configurations set for your particular usage.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only see bots in the version of Power Virtual Agents where you created them.  
>
> This means if you create a bot with the Power Virtual Agents app in Microsoft Teams, you will not see the bot in the web app of Power Virtual Agents at https://web.powerva.microsoft.com.

## Prerequisites

1. Choose the type of bot you want to create:

    - Use **Build for production** to create production bots that are intended to be deployed to your customers.

    - Use **Try the unified canvas (preview)** to test out the new authoring features in preview. These preview bots are supported in English only and aren't recommended for deploying for customer use.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you choose to create a preview bot, please refer to the [preview documentation](preview/overview.md).

1. For **Name your bot**, enter a name for your bot.

1. For **What language will your bot speak**, select the language you want your bot to speak.

1. Select **Create**.

## Delete a bot

You can delete bots to remove them from your environment.

1. You'll be asked to confirm the deletion of the bot by typing the bot's name. Once you confirm, all bot content will be deleted after a few minutes.

If your license has expired, you can delete your bot(s) by selecting **Permanently delete your bots**.

## Known issues with creating a bot

When you are creating your bot, you might encounter the following issues.

### Insufficient permissions for the selected environment

In this case, you see this error: "You do not have permissions to any environments. Please get access from an administrator."

You will need to [create a new environment](environments-first-run-experience.md). Use that environment to create your bot.
