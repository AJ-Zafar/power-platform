# Limitations of technology preview

This technology preview doesn't yet support some of the existing features you're used to in Power Virtual Agents and available features have some limitations.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These are the current limitations as of 5/12/2022.

## Limitations of current features

- Analytics take 8 hours to update.
- Bots can't be deleted.
- When sharing a bot, any Power Automate flows used in the conversation logic will not be shared. You'll have to manually share those flows if desired.  
- [Message variations](authoring-create-edit-topics.md#message-variations) do not vary in a single conversation. You'll only see differences between different conversations.
- The **Track between topics** toggle in the [test bot pane](authoring-test-bot.md) doesn't work.
- Quick replies are not read over [Telephony channel](publication-connect-bot-to-telephony.md)

## Coming in future releases

- Custom entities
- Skills
- Security options for your bot
- Channels (including Teams and Facebook Messenger)
- Agent transfers
- AI capabilities
- Authoring in Teams app
- Bots setup with application lifecycle management (ALM)
