# Limitations of technology preview

- Analytics take 8 hours to update.
- Bots can't be deleted.
- When sharing a bot, any Power Automate flows used in the conversation logic will not be shared. You'll have to manually share those flows if desired.  
- [Message variations]() do not vary in a single conversation. You'll only see differences between different conversations.
- The **Track between topics** toggle in the [test bot pane](authoring-test-bot.md) doesn't work.

## Coming in future releases

- Custom entities
- Skills
- Security options for your bot
- Channels (including Teams and Facebook Messenger)
- Agent transfers
- AI capabilities
- Authoring in Teams app
- Bots setup with application lifecycle management (ALM)
- Importing and exporting bots
- Non-English bots
- Extending bots in Composer
- Customization of system fallback topic
