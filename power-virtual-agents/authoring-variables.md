# Use variables

Select the version of Power Virtual Agents you're using here:

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
>
> - [Power Virtual Agents web app](authoring-variables.md)
> - [Power Virtual Agents app in Microsoft Teams](teams/authoring-variables-teams.md)

Save customers' responses in a bot conversation to variables and reuse them later in the conversation. Or, use variables to create logical expressions that dynamically route the customer down different conversation paths.

For example, save a customer's name in a variable called `UserName` and the bot can address the customer by name as the conversation continues.

You can also pass variables to [Power Automate](advanced-flow.md) and [Bot Framework skills](/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-skills-overview?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&preserve-view=true) as input parameters, and save the output results from those actions.  

## Prerequisites

- [!INCLUDE [Medical and emergency usage](includes/pva-usage-limitations.md)]

## Entity and variable type

Power Virtual Agents uses [entities](advanced-entities-slot-filling.md) to identify a specific type of information from a user's responses. A variable type is associated with the identified information when it's saved. The variable type is analogous with the entity.

<!-- FIXME: variable types are now separate from entities as you can set array and object types, which do not have an entity equivalents -->

Each entity or variable type maps to a base type, as listed in the following table. The base type determines the operators that you can use when you construct a logical expression with the corresponding variable. It also determines whether you can feed a variable to a [flow](advanced-flow.md) or [Bot Framework skill](/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-skills-overview?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&preserve-view=true) as an input parameter.

For example, a **boolean** base type maps to an operator "is equal to" with possible values being True or False. A **number** base type gives you numeric operators such as "is equal to," "is greater than," or "is greater than or equal to," and so on.

## Create a variable

Variables can be created in any node that prompts you to select a variable, such as the **Set Variable Value** node.

1. Select **+** to add a node, select **Set a variable value**.

1. In the **Set variable** box, select the **>** arrow.

    :::image type="content" source="media/authoring-variables/create-new-variable-button.png" alt-text="Create a variable.":::

1. In the flyout menu that appears, select **Create a new variable**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/authoring-variables/create-variable.png" alt-text="Create a variable.":::

A new variable will be created with a type that's appropriate for its usage. Use the [variable properties pane](#variable-properties-pane) to rename it.

## Set a variable

Usually you'll use a [question node](authoring-create-edit-topics.md#ask-a-question) to save user input to a variable, but there may be situations where you want to set the value manually.

1. To assign a value to a [variable](authoring-variables.md), select **+** to add a node, select **Set a variable value**.

1. For **Set variable**, choose or create a [new variable](#create-a-variable).

    <!-- FIXME: link to powerfx -->
1. For **To value**, directly enter a value, select another variable, or use a [PowerFX equation]().

## Use literal values

You can type a literal value into any variable input field instead of selecting a variable from the menu.

:::image type="content" source="media/authoring-variables/set-redirect-variable-to-literal.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the authoring canvas showing literal input on an input variable in a redirect node.":::

## Variables pane

To open the variables pane, in the topic's menu bar, select **Variables**.

:::image type="content" source="media/authoring-variables/open-variable-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the variables button.":::

For each of the variables in the topic, select whether you want the values to be passed, received, or both between topics.

:::image type="content" source="media/authoring-variables/variables-pane.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the variables pane.":::

## Variable properties pane

To open the variable properties pane, select a variable in the [variables pane](#variables-pane).

You can also open the variable properties pane by selecting a variable in any node.

:::image type="content" source="media/authoring-variables/select-a-variable.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting a variable to open the variable properties pane.":::

In the variable properties pane you can rename a variable, see where a variable is used, or convert a variable to a [global variable](authoring-variables-bot.md).

:::image type="content" source="media/authoring-variables/variable-properties.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the properties pane.":::

## Use variables in action nodes

<!-- FIXME: does this still work this way?  -->

When you use a variable in an action node, if its base type matches a parameter type that's specified for a flow or Bot Framework skill, you can pass it to that parameter. The output from action nodes generates new variables.  

:::image type="content" source="media/authoring-variables/User_a_variable_in_Skills(draft).PNG" alt-text="Screenshot of using an entity in an action node.":::

## Passing variables between topics

When you redirect to other topics, you can pass values into variables in the destination topic or get variables back from it. Passing variables between topics is especially useful when you already have information that the topic needs. Your users will appreciate not having to answer the question again. It's also helpful when you refactor and separate your topics into reusable components and you want to pass variables across the topics.

> [!NOTE]
> Variables of type `Custom Entity`, `Date Time`, and `Duration` can't be passed between topics.  

### Receive values from other topics

When a topic defines a variable (for example, by a question node), the bot asks the user the question to fill in the variableâ€™s value. If the bot has already acquired the value, there's no reason to ask the question again. In these cases, you can define the variable as **Receive values from other topics**. When another topic redirects to this one, it can pass a variable (or [literal values](#use-literal-values)) into this variable and skip the question. The experience for the user talking to the bot is seamless.

To receive values from other topics, set the variable's property:

1. In the **Question** node, select the variable that you want to receive values from other topics.

1. In the **Variables properties** pane,  under **Topic (limited scope)** select **Receive values from other topics**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/authoring-variables/authoring-subtopic-pass-variable-properties-receive-input.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the authoring canvas showing the Variable properties pane with Receive values from other topics selected.":::

1. Save the topic.

1. Go to a topic that you want to redirect to. Follow the steps in [Redirect to another topic](authoring-create-edit-topics.md#redirect-to-another-topic) to redirect to the correct topic.

1. Select **+ Add input for destination topic**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/authoring-variables/authoring-subtopic-pass-variable-step1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the authoring canvas showing adding input for the destination topic.":::

1. Select a variable in the redirected topic that you want to pass the variable to.

    :::image type="content" source="media/authoring-variables/authoring-subtopic-pass-variable-step2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the authoring canvas showing selecting the variable in the redirected topic.":::

1. Under **Enter or select a value**, select the variable in the current topic that you want to pass to the redirected topic.

    :::image type="content" source="media/authoring-variables/authoring-subtopic-pass-variable-step3.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the authoring canvas showing selecting the variable from the list of options.":::

    The variable is shown in the redirected node.

    :::image type="content" source="media/authoring-variables/authoring-subtopic-pass-variable-step4.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the authoring canvas showing the variable being passed into the redirected node.":::

### Return values to original topics

When a topic asks a question, or obtains a variable from an action in some other way, the variable can be returned to the original topic that redirected to it.

In this case, the variable also becomes part of the original topic and can be used like any other variable. This helps you construct the topic so that information the bot obtains is available across topics, reducing the need for global variables.

To return a variable to the original topic, set the variable's property:

1. In the **Question** node, select the variable that you want to receive values from other topics.

1. In the **Variables properties** pane, under **Topic (limited scope)** select **Return values to original topics**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/authoring-variables/authoring-subtopic-pass-variable-properties-return-value.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the authoring canvas showing the Variable properties pane with Return values to original topic selected.":::

1. Save the topic.

1. Go to a topic that you want to redirect to. Follow the steps in [Redirect to another topic](authoring-create-edit-topics.md#redirect-to-another-topic) to redirect to the correct topic.

    The variable that's being returned to the topic is shown in the redirected topic. Use the returned variable in your topic.
