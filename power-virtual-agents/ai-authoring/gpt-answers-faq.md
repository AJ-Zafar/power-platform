# FAQ for GPT Answers feature 
## General
### What is GPT Answers  ?
GPT Answers increases the number of topics your bot is conversational in, without requiring any manual dialog tree authoring. When a user asks the bot a question for which no topic is configured, instead of defaulting to a fallback, we search for relevant content on a website of your choosing and then use GPT    to summarize that information into a response that is returned to the user. 
### What data has GPT Answers been trained on?
GPT Answers is powered by Azure OpenAI’s GPT-3 model. GPT models are  pretrained on a wide body of publicly available free text data  . This data is sourced from a combination of web crawling, English-language Wikipedia, and more. Learn more about Azure OpenAI.   
### Does GPT Answers produce perfect responses?   
Responses generated by GPT Answers are not always perfect. The system is designed to query knowledge from the website of your choosing and to package relevant findings into an easily consumable response. While we have implemented mitigations to prevent GPT from relying on its training data as a knowledge source, which could generate responses with outdated information (GPT's training data cuts off in 2021   ), it is possible for GPT to “hallucinate” and not strictly stick to the content disclosed on the website you selected. The system does not perform an accuracy check, so if the selected website contains inaccurate information this could be surfaced to the users. Also, while we have implemented mitigations to filter out irrelevant and offensive responses, these filters are not foolproof. Bot authors should be carefully test, review, and vet bots before publishing them in production. Publishing bots with GPT Answers requires your admin approval.
### How was GPT Answers evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?   
GPT Answers was evaluated on a collection of manually curated Question/Answers datasets covering multiple industries (retail, insurance, services, etc.). AI generated response was compared against ideal response using semantic similarity. Semantic similarity was evaluated using a custom embedding model (trained on a large corpus of publicly available business data) where both AI answer and curated answer were evaluated in the same semantic space. Additionally, we assess level of overlap between AI generated response and curated response using Rouge-1 and BLEU scores.

Additional evaluation was performed over custom datasets for offensive and malicious prompts and responses where precision and recall was measured on a labelled dataset.
### How does a customer get the most out of GPT Answers?
GPT Answers works best when you designate a trusted and valid website as the source of truth from which content should be queried. This may be your company website, e.g. www.microsoft.com. All webpages that belong to this domain will be searched for a match against the user’s  question.
### How can a customer contribute?
Feedback you provide on your satisfaction with generated responses will be used to improve system quality. You can provide feedback by selecting thumbs up/ thumbs down for responses generated through GPT Answers. You also have the option to include more feedback in free text.
## Fairness and broader impact
### Will GPT Answers work as well using languages other than  English?
The system supports English language only, through inaccurate responses may be returned when users converse with the system in languages other than English.
### Does GPT Answers produce offensive outputs?
We have implemented mitigations to filter out offensive user queries, search results, and GPT-generated responses. The system is designed to not respond when offensive language is detected. Note these mitigations are not foolproof. 
## Privacy
### What data does GPT Answers collect? How is the data used?
GPT Answers collects user prompts, the responses returned by the system, and any feedback you may choose to provide. We use this data to evaluate and improve the quality of GPT Answers. More information on what data is collected is available in the GPT Answers Preview Terms .  

 
## Appendix: Guidance for FAQ
As a next step from the Impact Assessment review of the PVA with Bing/GPT fallback feature, we will need to include in the UI additional information to customers using the guiding questions in Transparency FAQ .docx.
