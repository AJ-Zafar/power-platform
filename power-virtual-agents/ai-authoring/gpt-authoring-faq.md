# GPT Builder training, model, and usage FAQ

Notes for reviewers:

- [] Headings and terminology used to describe the features will change. I will update as info comes in.
- [] The UI is changing daily, so consider all screenshots as placeholders. I will do a final sweep the day before we go live to ensure all screens and associated labels/descriptions are updated.
- [] Please ignore the indentation/formatting of lists.
- [] Is the model "text-davinci-003"? Is this model used in the Answers feature as well?
- [] What do you mean by "monitor output"? What does "monitor" mean, and what sort of "output" are you monitoring?
- [] What is "synthetic generation"?
- [] We don't mention the testing methods (rogue/blue) in this authoring faq, but we do in the answers faq. Should it be here as well?

This FAQ document answers common questions about the AI that is used when creating new topics, or modifying existing topics, in Power Virtual Agents.

It should be read alongside the [GPT Authoring Learn topic](gpt-authoring.md). 

## General

### What is GPT Builder?

When GPT Builder is enabled, your chatbot will use AI, powered by the Azure OpenAI GPT-3 model (which is also used in Bing), to create bot topics based upon a simple description of what you want to achieve.

You can also modify and update any topic in your bot in the same manner, by describing the changes you want to make. 

### What data has GPT Builder been trained on?

GPT Builder is powered by the Azure OpenAI GPT-3 (==text-davinci-003==[^da3]) model. GPT models are trained on a corpus consisting of a wide body of publicly available free text data. This data is sourced from a combination of web crawling, English-language Wikipedia, and more. [Learn more about Azure OpenAI](/legal/cognitive-services/openai/transparency-note). 


[^da3]: is it text-davinci-003? Is this the same for Answers?


### Does GPT Builder produce perfect Topics? Does it produce offensive outputs or topics?

Topics generated by GPT Builder are not always perfect, and may not accurately reflect the logic you wanted to implement. 

The system is designed to generate a single bot topic from a human-written description. We have implemented mitigations to filter out irrelevant and offensive language from appearing in the configured topic, and the system is designed not to respond when offensive language is detected. 

We also monitor output and the feedback that bot users provide to continually improve our content filters.

These filters and mitigations are not foolproof.

You should always test and review your bots before publishing them.


### How was GPT Builder evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?   

GPT Builder was evaluated on a collection of manually curated prompt-and-topic datasets, covering common, edge-case, and offensive content, as well as synthetic generation.

Topics generated from GPT Builder were manually reviewed and scored for relevance to the input prompt, usefulness, and offensiveness. 

### How does a bot maker get the most out of GPT Builder?

You should include granular instructions in your description and limit the scope of the description to a single topic. 

See the [GPT Authoring Learn topic](gpt-authoring.md) for examples and suggestions. 

### How can a customer contribute?

Chatbot users, either on the published chatbot, or within the **Test bot** panel, can provide feedback you provide on every generated response by using the "thumbs up" and "thumbs down" icons under the response. Users can also include more verbose feedback, when prompted after interacting with the icons. 

## Fairness and broader impact

### Will GPT Builder work as well using languages other than English?

The system only supports English. Inaccurate responses may be returned when users converse with the system in languages other than English.

## Privacy

### What data does GPT Builder collect? How is the data used?
The system collects user prompts, the returned configured Topics, and any feedback you may choose to provide.

We use this data to evaluate and improve the quality of GPT Builder. More information on what data is collected is available in the [Power Virtual Agents GPT AI Preview Terms](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2224133).
