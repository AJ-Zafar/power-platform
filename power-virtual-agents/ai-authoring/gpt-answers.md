# Use GPT Answers to expand conversational reach (preview)

[!INCLUDE [Preview disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]




<!-- Work in Progress - TODO
> - [ ] Connect to intro and hub (when written...)
> - [ ] Check all naming/branding wording (descriptive vs named)
> - [ ] Add mgmt proc
> - [ ] Get lims (if usage exceeded then turn off GPT for test bot, otherwise contact MSFT support (sim to allowing publishing); single-turn convo; only publically available URLs indexed by Bing)
> - [ ] Confirm sub path limits (looks like 2 or 3 - recheck the en-us)
