1. Name the bot `Reservation Bot` and select **Create**.

1. On the Topics list, select the **Greeting** topic.

1. Delete all existing **Message** nodes.

    <!-- FIXME: link doc once written -->
1. Add a **Message** node. Then add the following greetings as [message variations]():
    - `Good day!`
    - `Hi there!`
    - `Hi!`

1. Add a second **Message** node and add the message `We're open 9am to 5pm Monday through Friday. If you'd like, I can help you make a reservation.`

    <!-- FIXME: link doc once written -->
