# Automated authoring overview (preview)

[!INCLUDE [AI tech disclosure with Bing Search](includes/disclosure-ai-preview-bing-addendum.md)]

By leveraging recent advancements in AI language models, Power Virtual Agents (preview) transforms how you build chatbots, increasing a chatbot's ability to respond to user input while at the same time significantly reducing manual authoring and configuration.

For example, if, during a conversation, a user asks a question for which the chatbot doesn't already have a topic, it can generate a response based on the information available in a "fallback" website. The response is presented in a natural, conversational tone. 


## Prerequisites
- You must be using the [preview version of Power Virtual Agents](preview/overview.md), and the bot type must be **Preview**. Preview chatbots have **(preview)** added to their name. When you create a new bot, select **Try the unified canvas (preview)**.
