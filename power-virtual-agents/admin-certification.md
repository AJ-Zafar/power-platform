# Standards compliance and certification



Power Virtual Agents is a Core Online Service, as defined in the [Online Services Terms (OST)](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/products), and as such is compliant with a number of International Organization for Standardization (ISO) certifications. Power Virtual Agents is also compliant with System and Organization Controls (SOC) 2 and is covered under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Business Associate Agreement BAA).

This means you can create chatbots that handle protected health information, as in the following scenarios where the chatbot can:
1. Ask individuals to provide their health information (blood pressure, weight, and so on).
1. Capture health information and personally identifying information, such as the customerâ€™s IP address or email address.
1. Give calculated health recommendations.

SOC 2 is a method for assuring control regulation within a service. Power Virtual Agents has been audited to be compliant with SOC 2.
