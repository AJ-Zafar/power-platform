# Capture telemetry with Application Insights

You can use Bot Framework Composer with Power Virtual Agents to send event data to a telemetry service in [Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview). Telemetry offers insights into your bot by showing which features are used the most, detects unwanted behavior, and provides data on availability, performance, and usage.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Application Insights is a feature of [Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/overview), an extensible Application Performance Management (APM) tool that allows you to monitor your live applications. It requires a subscription to [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/).

## Connect Application Insights

To connect to your Application Insights service in Composer, you need to add your instrumentation key to the project.

1. Go to the **Configure** tab in Composer.
