# Overview (preview)

[!INCLUDE [Preview disclaimer](includes/public-preview-disclaimer.md)]

We are excited to announce the evolution of Power Virtual Agents.

The new intelligent bot authoring experience unifies the sophistication of Azure Bot Framework Composer pro-code capabilities with the simplicity of the Power Virtual Agents low-code platform, making it even easier for professional developers and subject matter experts to build collaboratively in one Microsoft bot building studio.

This evolution brings new features, including:

- Updates to authoring experience

  - [Add Images / Videos / Cards to a message](authoring-send-message.md)
  - [YAML code editor](authoring-create-edit-topics.md)
  - [Message variations](authoring-send-message.md#use-message-variations)
  - [Quick replies](authoring-send-message.md#use-quick-replies)
  - [Speech authoring](authoring-send-message.md#use-ssml-to-customize-speech-responses)


- Power FX and variable management
  - [Enhanced variable management](authoring-variables.md)
  - [Power Fx support](advanced-power-fx.md)

For a guided tutorial on how to use these new features, please refer to the [quickstart](quickstart.md).

The Power Virtual Agents preview doesn't yet support some of the existing features you're used to in Power Virtual Agents, such as agent transfers, and bot authoring in Teams. For the complete list, see [Limitations of public preview](limitations.md).
