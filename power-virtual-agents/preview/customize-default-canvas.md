# Customize the look and feel of your bot (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [Preview disclaimer](includes/public-preview-disclaimer.md)]

Your bot's look and feel is defined by the bot's canvas. You can customize the canvas in two ways, depending on the complexity of the customizations:

- [Customize the default canvas](#customize-the-default-canvas-simple) with JavaScript-based styling in the HTML code of the website where you deploy your bot.  
    This approach is useful if you want to make small customizations without investing in code development.

- [Use a custom canvas](#customize-and-host-your-chat-canvas-advanced) that's based on the [Bot Framework Web Chat canvas](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat).  
    This approach requires extensive developer knowledge. It's useful for organizations that want a completely custom experience.

## Change your bot's name

If all you want to change is your bot's name, you can do that easily in your bot's settings in Power Virtual Agents.

1. In the left side panel, select **Settings**, and then select **General**.

1. Type a new name for your bot, and then select **Save**.

## Find your bot's app ID and tenant ID

You'll need to know your bot's app ID and tenant ID to customize the canvas, whether it's the default canvas or a custom one you connect to.

1. In the left side panel, select **Settings**, and then select **General**.

1. Select the **Advanced** tab.

## Customize the default canvas (simple)

You can customize your bot's default canvas with some simple CSS and JavaScript styling in an HTML file.

1. [Publish your bot](publication-connect-bot-to-web-channels.md).

1. Copy the HTML code below and save it to a local drive as *index.html*.  
    If you just want to try it out, you can paste the code into the [w3schools.com Tryit Editor](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_default) instead of saving it to a file.  

    ```HTML
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Contoso Sample Web Chat</title> 
        <!-- This styling is for the Web Chat demonstration purposes. It is recommended that style is moved to separate file for organization in larger projects -->
        <style>
            html, body {
                height: 100%;
            }

            body {
                margin: 0;
            }

            h1 {
                font-size: 16px;
                font-family: Segoe UI;
                line-height: 20px;
                color: whitesmoke;
                display: table-cell;
                padding: 13px 0px 0px 20px;
            }

            #heading {
                background-color: black;
                height: 50px;
            }

            .main {
                margin: 18px;
                border-radius: 4px;
            }

            div[role="form"]{
                background-color: black;
            }

            #webchat {
                position: fixed;
                height: calc(100% - 50px);
                width: 100%;
                top: 50px;
                overflow: hidden;
            }

        </style>

    </head>
    <body>
        <div>
            <div id="heading">
                <!-- Change the h1 text to change the bot name -->    
                <h1>Contoso Bot Name</h1>
            </div>
            <div id="webchat" role="main"></div>
        </div>    

      <script src="https://cdn.botframework.com/botframework-webchat/latest/webchat.js"></script>

      <script>
            const styleOptions = {

               // Add styleOptions to customize Web Chat canvas
               hideUploadButton: true
            };

            // Add your BOT ID below 
            var BOT_ID = "<ENTER YOUR BOT ID>"; 
            var theURL = "https://powerva.microsoft.com/api/botmanagement/v1/directline/directlinetoken?botId=" + BOT_ID;
        
          fetch(theURL)
                .then(response => response.json())
                .then(conversationInfo => {
                    window.WebChat.renderWebChat(
                        {
                            directLine: window.WebChat.createDirectLine({
                                token: conversationInfo.token,
                            }),
                            styleOptions
                        },
                        document.getElementById('webchat')
                    );
                })
                .catch(err => console.error("An error occurred: " + err));

        </script>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

1. In the HTML code, find the line that starts with `var BOT_ID =` and replace `<ENTER YOUR BOT ID>` with your bot's app ID.

1. Open *index.html* in a modern browser (for example, Microsoft Edge) to open the bot in the custom canvas.  
    If you're using the Tryit Editor, select **Run**.

1. Test the bot to make sure it's working correctly.  
    If you encounter problems, make sure you've published your bot, and that you inserted your bot ID in the right place. It should be after the equals sign (=) in the line `var BOT_ID`, and surrounded by double quotation marks (").

### Customize the bot icon, background color, and name

Use the JavaScript constant `styleOptions` to change pre-defined styles that define your bot's look and feel.

See [Web Chat customization](/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-webchat-customization?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&preserve-view=true) for links to the defaultStyleOptions.js file and more information on what you can customize and how it will look.

#### Change the bot icon

1. Add the following sample code to the *index.html* file:

    ```js
    const styleOptions = {
                botAvatarInitials: 'BT',
                accent: '#00809d',
                botAvatarBackgroundColor: "#FFFFFF",
                botAvatarImage: 'https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/v4sdk/media/logo_bot.svg',
                userAvatarImage: 'https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/661465'
            };  
    ```

1. Replace the bot and user avatar images in the code with your company images.  
    If you don't have an image URL, you can use a Base64-encoded image string instead.

#### Change the background color

1. Update the *index.html* file with following sample code:

    ```js
    const styleOptions = {
           
                backgroundColor: 'lightgray'

            };  
    ```

1. Change `backgroundColor` to any color using standard CSS color names, RGB values, or HEX values.

#### Change the bot's name

1. Update the `<h1>` text in the *index.html* file with the following code:

    ```HTML
    <body>
        <div id="heading">
             <!-- Change the h1 text to change the bot name -->
             <h1><img src="contosobot-teams.png"> Contoso Bot Name</h1>
        </div>

    ```

1. Change the text to whatever you want to call your bot. You can also insert an image, although you may need to style it to make sure it fits in the heading section.

## Customize and host your chat canvas (advanced)

The other way to change your bot's look and feel is to connect it to a custom canvas that's hosted as a web app. This approach is best if you need to embed a customized iFrame across multiple web pages.

> [!NOTE]
> Hosting a custom canvas requires software development. Our guidance here is intended for experienced IT professionals, such as IT admins or developers who have a good understanding of developer tools, utilities, and IDEs.

### Pick a sample to customize

We recommend starting with one of these samples custom-built to work with Power Virtual Agents:

- [Full bundle](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerVirtualAgentsSamples/tree/master/BuildYourOwnCanvasSamples/1.starter-full-bundle) is a custom canvas capable of showing all rich content from Power Virtual Agents. For example:

  :::image type="content" source="media/customize-default-canvas/custom-canvas-full-bundle.png" alt-text="Full bundle custom canvas." border="false":::

- [Location and file uploading](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerVirtualAgentsSamples/tree/master/BuildYourOwnCanvasSamples/2.location-and-file-uploading) is a custom canvas capable of getting a user's location and sending it to a bot using Power Virtual Agents. For example:

  :::image type="content" source="media/customize-default-canvas/custom-canvas-location-file-upload.png" alt-text="Location and file uploading custom canvas." border="false":::

Or you can pick from [other sample web chat canvases](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/#samples-list) provided by Bot Framework.

### Customize the canvas using `stylesetOptions`

As with customizing the default canvas, you can use `styleSetOptions` to customize the custom canvas. All customizable properties are listed in [defaultStyleOptions.js](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat/blob/main/packages/api/src/defaultStyleOptions.ts). For more information on what you can customize and how it will look, see [Web Chat customization](/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-webchat-customization?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&preserve-view=true).

### Deploy your customized canvas

Deploy all files to a web app.
