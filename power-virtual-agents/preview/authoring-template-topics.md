# Use sample topics in Power Virtual Agents (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [Preview disclaimer](includes/public-preview-disclaimer.md)]

Power Virtual Agents includes a set of three samples from which you can see examples of topics. These samples range from simple to complex scenarios that use [conditional branching](authoring-create-edit-topics.md) and [custom entities](advanced-entities-slot-filling.md).

## Access and use sample topics for new bots

When a bot is created, several samples are automatically created as topics.

While the topics are functional, they are examples to learn how to create content for your bots. The topics aren't designed for production use.

**Use sample topics to understand how topics work:**

1. Go to the **Topics** tab.

1. Select **Sample 1** and work through to **Sample 3**. Review the title and description, and see which trigger phrases are used.  

1. To see the bot's flow, select each topic. The flow includes the bot's comments, expected user responses, decision points, and entity references.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You will see these samples when you create a new bot. If you have previously created a bot and don't see them, try creating a new bot and then going to the **Topics** tab.

## Available sample topics

Each sample is designed to teach you how to use the authoring canvas to create basic and advanced bot conversations.

You should start with **Sample 1** and work through each sample in order.

### Sample 1 - Text variation with quick replies

This sample shows you how to create a simple topic with multiple text variation responses and a quick reply.

### Sample 2 - Question with images, quick replies, and a condition

This sample shows you how to create a simple question with an image and quick reply that identifies an [entity](advanced-entities-slot-filling.md) and stores it as [a variable](authoring-variables.md), a condition, and a redirect to the [next sample topic](#sample-3---set-variable-with-function).

When you use entities in your topic, the bot identifies key information from user responses and automatically fills in that information into your variables. A variable is a name for an item that will be used later in the topic flow.

In this sample, the bot uses the State entity to recognize any US state the user enters and stores it as the `state` variable. This variable is used in the condition to determine which shipping message to send the user. The topic ends by redirecting to the next sample topic.

### Sample 3 - Set variable with function

Sample 3 shows you how to create a topic with [a variable](authoring-variables.md) and set it to the value of a function. The shipping time message uses the variable and finishes by redirecting to the End of Conversation topic.
