# Add multimedia cards to messages (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [Preview disclaimer](includes/public-preview-disclaimer.md)]

Cards add rich multimedia responses to question and message nodes in your bot conversations. With cards, you can go beyond basic text replies by adding images, videos, and interactive elements.

Several types of cards provide different experiences to users. You can preview all types on the authoring canvas in real time.

## Manage multiple cards in the same node

If you add more than one card to a node, two display options will appear in the node's menu when a card is selected:

- **Carousel** displays one card at a time.
- **List** displays all cards in a vertical list.

To remove a card from a node, select the **Delete** icon at the upper-right corner of the card.
