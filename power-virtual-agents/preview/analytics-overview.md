# Analyze your bot's usage and performance (preview)

[!INCLUDE [Preview disclaimer](includes/public-preview-disclaimer.md)]

As a maker, your job isn't done when your bot is published and in use. You'll want to know how well your bot is performing its intended duties. The comprehensive analytics in Power Virtual Agents keep your bot's key performance indicators front and center. Multiple charts show you trends and usage for your bot's topics. These charts use AI to highlight the topics that have the greatest effect on your bot's performance.

> [!NOTE]
> Bot analytics in Power Virtual Agents US Government Cloud plans will be released at a later date. In the meantime, you can use a [custom analytics solution to create a Power BI dashboard](https://powervirtualagents.microsoft.com/blog/custom-analytics-solution-for-power-virtual-agents/) to get analytics in these plans.
