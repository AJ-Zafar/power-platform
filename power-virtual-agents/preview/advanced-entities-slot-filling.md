# Use entities and slot filling in Power Virtual Agents bots (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [Preview disclaimer](includes/public-preview-disclaimer.md)]

A big part of bot conversations in Power Virtual Agents is natural language understanding, which is the ability of the AI to understand a user's intent. For example, natural language understanding is involved when a user might say, "I tried to use my gift card, but it doesn't work", and the bot can route the user to the topic related to gift cards not workingâ€”even if that exact phrase isn't listed as a trigger phrase.

One fundamental aspect of natural language understanding is to identify _entities_ in a user dialog. An entity can be viewed as an information unit that represents a certain type of real-world subject, like a phone number, zip code, city, or even a person's name.

## Prebuilt entities

Power Virtual Agents comes with a set of prebuilt entities, which represent the most commonly used stereotype information in real-world dialogs, such as age, colors, numbers, and names.

With the knowledge granted by entities, a bot can smartly recognize the relevant information from a user input and save it for later use.

## Use entities in a conversation

1. Go to the [**Topics page**](./authoring-create-edit-topics.md) for the bot you want to edit.

1. Open the authoring canvas for the topic you want to add an entity to.

1. Select the plus (**+**) icon and then select **Ask a question**.
