# Customize speech responses with SSML (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [Preview disclaimer](../includes/public-preview-disclaimer.md)]

Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is an XML-based markup language that specifies how text is converted into synthesized speech. It's one of the many ways Power Virtual Agents makes your bot's responses sound like natural speech. You can use SSML in bots that are connected to the [Telephony channel](publication-connect-bot-to-telephony.md).

## Prerequisites

- [Create and edit topics](authoring-create-edit-topics.md)
- [Connect your bot to the Telephony channel](publication-connect-bot-to-telephony.md)

## Create a speech message

1. Go to the authoring canvas of the topic you want to add a speech response to.

1. Select the plus (**+**) icon, and then select **Send a message** to add a message node.

1. Select **Text**, and then select **Speech** to change the response mode from text to speech.

    The following message will show after you switch from text to speech.

1. Select **+ Add**, and then select **Message variation**.

1. Enter what you want the bot to say. Add as many [message variations](authoring-create-edit-topics.md#message-variations) as needed.

Now that you've created a speech message, you can add SSML to your message variations.

## Use SSML to customize speech responses

In the message, select **SSML tags**, and then select the tags you want to add.

The table below describes what each tag does:

| SSML tag | Description |
|---|---|
| Audio | Add prerecorded audio. |
| Break | Insert pauses or breaks between words. |
| Emphasis | Add levels of stress to words or phrases. |
| Prosody | Specify changes to pitch, contour, range, rate, and volume. |

You can add multiple tags to a single speech variation. You can also add SSML tags that don't appear in the helper menu. [Learn more about SSML](/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-synthesis-markup).
