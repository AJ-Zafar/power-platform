## Work with session transcripts

The session transcript is a comma-separated values (CSV) file that contains the following information:

- **SessionID**: The session's unique identifier
- **StartDateTime**: The time the session started (by default, sessions are sorted by this column in descending order)
- **InitialUserMessage**: The first message the user typed
- **TopicName**: The name of the last authored topic that was triggered in the session
- **ChatTranscript**: The transcript of the session in the format **User says: ; Bot says: ;**  
    For example:

    ```text
    User says: store hours; Bot says: Which store are you asking about?; User says: Bellevue; Bot says: Bellevue store is open from 10am to 7pm every day.;
    ```

    **Bot says** doesn't include the options presented to the user.

- **SessionOutcome**: The outcome of the session (Resolved, Escalated, Abandoned, Unengaged)
- **TopicId**: The unique identifier of the last authored topic triggered in the session
