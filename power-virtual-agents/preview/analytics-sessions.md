# Download your bot session transcripts

[!INCLUDE [Preview disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

You can download bot session or conversation transcripts from the past 30 days in both Power Virtual Agents and Power Apps. You can also change the retention period for transcripts from the default 30 days.

> [!NOTE]
> If you no longer have access to your environment, you'll need to [create a support request](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/support) in the Power Platform admin center.

## Download session transcripts in Power Virtual Agents

1. In the left side panel, select **Analytics**. Select the **Sessions** tab.

    If your bot has many sessions, they're broken down into multiple rows. Each row contains 2,500 sessions.

1. Select a row to download the session transcripts for the specified time frame.

    :::image type="content" source="media/analytics-sessions/analytics-sessions-billing.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Analytics > Sessions page, with a session highlighted.":::

The download starts when you select the time period. The file is saved to your browser's default download location.

The session transcript is a comma-separated values (CSV) file that contains the following information:

- **SessionID**: The session's unique identifier
- **StartDateTime**: The time the session started (by default, sessions are sorted by this column in descending order)
- **InitialUserMessage**: The first message the user typed
- **TopicName**: The name of the last authored topic that was triggered in the session
- **ChatTranscript**: The transcript of the session in the format **User says: ; Bot says: ;**  
    For example:

    ```text
    User says: store hours; Bot says: Which store are you asking about?; User says: Bellevue; Bot says: Bellevue store is open from 10am to 7pm every day.;
    ```

    **Bot says** doesn't include the options presented to the user.

- **SessionOutcome**: The outcome of the session (Resolved, Escalated, Abandoned, Unengaged)
- **TopicId**: The unique identifier of the last authored topic triggered in the session

## Change the default retention period

The default bulk delete job automatically removes conversation transcripts that are older than 30 days. To keep the transcripts longer, cancel the existing job and create a new one that runs on a different schedule. You'll need to do this in Power Apps.
