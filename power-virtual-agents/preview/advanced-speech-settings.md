1. In the **Voice font** list, select the voice that works best for your bot.

1. In the **Speaking style** list, select a style that's appropriate for your domain and context.

### Speaking styles

Some voice fonts come with a choice of speaking styles. Speaking styles add linguistic variety to your bots. You can use them to tailor your bot's speech for specific domains.

For example, you might select **newscast** for a bot that delivers news, **chat** for a friendly chat bot, or **customerservice** for bots that handle customer service tasks. Other options add emotions like **excited** to your bot's speech, or specify a type of speech, like **whispering**.
