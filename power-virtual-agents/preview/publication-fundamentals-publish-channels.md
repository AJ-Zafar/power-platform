# Publish your bot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [Preview disclaimer](includes/public-preview-disclaimer.md)]

You need to publish your bot before your customers can engage with it. You can publish your bot on multiple platforms, or channels.

After you've published your bot to at least one channel, you can connect it to more channels. Remember to publish your bot again after you make any changes to it. Publishing your bot updates it across all the channels it's connected to.

## Publish the latest bot content

You need to publish your bot at least once before your customers can interact with it or you can share it with your teammates. You must publish the bot again if you update it. If you don't, your customers won't be engaging with the latest content.

1. With your bot open for editing, in the navigation menu, select **Publish**.

1. Select **Publish**, and then confirm, to make the latest content available to your customers.

    Publishing can take up to a few minutes.

Test your bot after publishing completes. Select the **demo website** link to open a prebuilt demo website in a new tab. You and your team can interact with the bot here. The demo website is also useful to gather feedback from stakeholders before you roll your bot out to customers.

For details on updating the welcome message and help text on the demo website, go to [Configure the demo website and add the bot to your live website](publication-connect-bot-to-web-channels.md).

> [!TIP]
> **What's the difference between the test chat and the demo website?**  
> Use the test chat while you're building your bot to make sure conversation flows as expected and to spot errors.
> Share the demo website URL with members of your team or other stakeholders who want to try out the bot. The demo website isn't intended for production use. You shouldn't share the URL with customers.
