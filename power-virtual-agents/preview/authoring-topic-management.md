# Manage topics in Power Virtual Agents

[!INCLUDE [Preview disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

There are a number of ways you can manage your topics. Power Virtual Agents includes a topic checker that lets you know if there are errors in your topics, you can turn topics on or off so they don't appear to people chatting with your bot, and you can copy or duplicate topics to make it easier to create new ones.

## Topic errors

When you save a topic, Power Virtual Agents notifies you if there are errors or warnings. Warnings won't stop the bot from working, but they may cause individual topics not to work as expected, so you should fix them when you see them.

Errors will prevent the bot from working and must be fixed before you can publish your bot.

You can see the error state of a topic on the Topics page.

> [!NOTE]
> Unlike warnings, the Topics page only shows errors because they will stop your bot from working.

:::image type="content" source="media/authoring-topic-management/topics-errors.png" alt-text="The topics page identifies the number of errors in your topic.":::

Select the error count to open the authoring canvas to where the first error is. Select **Topic checker** to see a list of the errors. Selecting each error goes directly to the error.

> You can save topics with errors but can't publish them.

### Types of errors

There are four types of errors that appear in the topic checker and the authoring canvas:

- _Node_: The entire node is incorrect and is highlighted in red.
- _Field_: The field might be missing required data and is highlighted in red.
- _Expression_: The expression might be invalid and is highlighted in red.
- _Variable deletion_: A variable in a topic was deleted and is highlighted in red wherever it was used. This causes the variable to become "orphaned" and must be either removed or replaced.

## Topic status

Topics can have a status of **On** or **Off**. This refers to their ability to be used or triggered in a bot conversation.

When a topic is **On**, it will trigger as expected, either as a result of its trigger phrases or when it is redirected from another topic. The majority of your topics are likely to be in the **On** state.

When a topic is **Off**, it will not trigger at all. This means that if its trigger phrases are used in a bot conversation, it will not trigger, just as if the topic doesn't exist. An **Off** topic will also not be redirected to, even if another topic has specified that it should be.

When you publish your bot, all topics are published whether they're **On or Off**. Topics that are **Off** won't trigger, however.
> [!TIP]
> Turning a topic to **Off** allows you to work on a particular topic and leave it in a draft state while publishing changes to other topics that are ready to go live.  
>
> Leave the topic that you are still working on as **Off** before publishing the bot.

You can change this with the toggle in the **Status** column on the Topics page.

:::image type="content" source="media/authoring-topic-management/topics-status.png" alt-text="The Status column shows each topic with an On or Off toggle switch.":::

By default, new topics will be created with their status set to **On**.

> [!NOTE]
> The Topic Checker will identify an error if a topic redirects to an 'off' topic.

## Copy a topic

Once you have created a few topics, you may want to use a previous topic as a baseline when creating new topics.

On the Topics page, select the menu icon on a topic's name and then **Make a copy**.

:::image type="content" source="media/authoring-topic-management/topics-menu-icon.png" alt-text="Make a copy from the menu icon." border="false":::

This option duplicates the selected topic with _(Copy)_ added to the name. All of the topic content - such as the description, trigger phrases, and the entire conversation - is copied over to the new topic.

A copied topic is **Off** by default to avoid confusion with the original topic, which has the same trigger phrases.

Once you are done editing the new topic, you can turn it **On** to [test it in the Test bot](authoring-test-bot.md) and, when ready, publish the new topic.

There is no limit to the number of times you can copy a topic. A number will be added to the name and each topic will have its own internal ID.
