Power Virtual Agents lets you create powerful chatbots, right in Microsoft Teams, that can answer questions posed by other employees or team members.

For example, you could create a bot that answers questions people might have about their benefits, or whether conference rooms are open, or what they need to know before returning to their workplace.

With Power Virtual Agents in teams you can:

- [Create bots in seconds](authoring-fundamentals-teams.md)
- Have bots [take actions on someone's behalf](advanced-fundamentals-teams.md)
- [Review and analyze the performance of the bot](analytics-overview-teams.md), such as what questions are being asked the most, and how effective the bot is at understanding and answering questions
