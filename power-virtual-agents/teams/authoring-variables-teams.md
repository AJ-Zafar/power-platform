# Use variables in Teams

Select the version of Power Virtual Agents you're using here:

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
> - [Web service (https://powerva.microsoft.com)](../authoring-variables.md)
> - [Teams (online or app)](authoring-variables-teams.md)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer-teams.md)]

Variables let you save responses from your customers in a conversation with your bot so that you can reuse them later in the conversation. 

For example, you can save a customer's name in a variable called `UserName`. The bot can then address the customer by name as the conversation continues.

You can add and use variables in a bot's authoring canvas in Microsoft Teams, but you should review and refer to online portal version of this topic for more information: [Use variables](../authoring-variables.md)
