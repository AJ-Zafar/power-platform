# Assign licenses and manage access to Power Virtual Agents in Teams

Select the version of Power Virtual Agents you're using here:

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
> - [Online portal (https://powerva.microsoft.com)](../requirements-licensing.md)
> - [Teams (online or app)](requirements-licensing-teams.md)

To create and manage Power Virtual Agents chatbots in Teams, you need:

- [A license to use Teams](/MicrosoftTeams/user-access)
- [Licenses to use Power Virtual Agents](../requirements-licensing.md)


If you can access Teams, and if you can add the Power Virtual Agents app, then it's likely you already have all the necessary licenses. Users of your bot will also need to access Teams, but you can't add users to a team unless they already have access to Teams as a whole.

If you need more information about licenses, see the following topics:

- [Manage user access to Teams](/MicrosoftTeams/user-access)
- [Assign licenses and manage access to Power Virtual Agents](../requirements-licensing.md)
