You can create chatbots in the Power Virtual Agents app in Teams and then share them with other people in your team, company, or organization.

The very first step is to add the Power Virtual Agents app. Then you can create bots.


## Prerequisites

- [!INCLUDE [Medical and emergency usage](includes/pva-usage-limitations-teams.md)]


## Add the Power Virtual Agents app in Microsoft Teams

1. Select **Apps** at the bottom of the navigation pane in Microsoft Teams

2. In the search box, type *power virtual agents* and then select the tile that appears. Select **Add for me** in the description window that pops up. This adds the app to the navigation panel.

## Create a bot


When you create a bot, it has to go into a team - everyone in that team will be able to see and use the bot (but you can share it with people in other teams later on). The first bot you create will take 5 to 10 minutes to build, but every bot after that will take much less time (around 1 or 2 minutes).


1. Select the **Power Virtual Agents** icon to open the app.
2. You can create a new bot two ways:
   - Select **Start now** and then choose the team you want to use.
   - Go to the **Chatbots** tab, select the team you want to use, and then **New chatbot**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >All bots have to belong to a team. You can [create a new team](/MicrosoftTeams/get-started-with-teams-create-your-first-teams-and-channels#create-a-team) if necessary, before you add a bot to it.

If this is the first time a bot is being created in your team, you'll see a notice explaining that it will take some time (this could take from 1 to 10 minutes):

1. Select **Create** to begin the initial bot-building process for your team, which can take a few minutes.

   You can close the loading window, a notification will appear as a pop-up and also in your list of notifications when the bot is ready:

1. After the building process is finished, you can create a bot in your team. In the list of teams, select your team and then **New chatbot** to make your bot.

## Delete a bot

You can delete bots to remove them from your team. 

1. Click the settings cog icon at the bottom of the Power Virtual Agents side navigation pane.

2. On the **General** tab, select **Delete bot**.

You'll be asked to confirm the deletion of the bot by entering the bot's name, after which all bot content is immediately deleted.
