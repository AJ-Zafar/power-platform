You can create chatbots in the Power Virtual Agents app in Teams and then share them with other people in your team, company, or organization.

The very first step is to add the Power Virtual Agents app. Then you can create bots.


## Prerequisites

- [!INCLUDE [Medical and emergency usage](includes/pva-usage-limitations-teams.md)]


## Add the Power Virtual Agents app in Microsoft Teams

1. Select **Apps** at the bottom of the navigation pane in Microsoft Teams

2. In the search box, type *power virtual agents* and then select the tile that appears. Select **Add for me** in the description window that pops up. This adds the app to the navigation panel.

## Create a bot


When you create a bot, it has to go into a team - everyone in that team will be able to see and use the bot (but you can share it with people in other teams later on). The first bot you create will take 5 to 10 minutes to build, but every bot after that will take much less time (around 1 or 2 minutes).


1. Select the **Power Virtual Agents** icon to open the app.
2. You can create a new bot two ways:
   - Select **Start now** and then choose the team you want to use.
   - Go to the **Chatbots** tab, select the team you want to use, and then **New chatbot**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >All bots have to belong to a team. You can [create a new team](/MicrosoftTeams/get-started-with-teams-create-your-first-teams-and-channels#create-a-team) if necessary, before you add a bot to it.

3. Enter a name for your bot.

1. Select **Create** to begin the bot-building process, which can take up to 15 minutes for the first bot you create in a team. The next time you create a bot it will take much less time.


During the building process, you'll see a notification at the top of the Power Virtual Agents portal indicating that the bot is still being built.

You can go to some tabs while the bot is being built. When the bot is fully built, you'll see a notification and your bot will appear in the list of bots for your team. You'll then have full access to your bot.
 






## Delete a bot

You can delete bots to remove them from your team. 


You'll be asked to confirm the deletion of the bot, after which all bot content is immediately deleted.

If your license has expired, you can delete your bot(s) by selecting **Permanently delete your bots**.
