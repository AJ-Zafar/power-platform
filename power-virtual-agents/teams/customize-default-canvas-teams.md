# Customize the look and feel of the bot's default canvas in Teams

Select the version of Power Virtual Agents you're using here:

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
> - [Power Virtual Agents web app](../customize-default-canvas.md)
> - [Power Virtual Agents app in Microsoft Teams](customize-default-canvas-teams.md)

You can customize how the bot looks when added as an app in Microsoft Teams. You can change the icon
and the bot name at any time, and add a long and short description when you publish the bot.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Updates to the bot's icon and color may take up to 24 hours to show on bots that are already published and shared.

## Prerequisites

- [!INCLUDE [Medical and emergency usage](includes/pva-usage-limitations-teams.md)]

## Change the bot icon and name

1. On the side navigation pane, select **Manage** and then **Details**.

2. Make changes to the **Bot name** and icon.  
    The icon needs to be an image type and can be any size - it will be automatically resized and positioned so it is in the middle of the colored square. 
    We recommend you use a 32x32 pixel or 64x64 pixel .png file with transparency, so that way the color will come through the icon.


3. When you're finished, select **Save** on the top menu bar.

4. Select **Reset** to revert your changes to the previously saved version.

## Change the bot color and description

When [preparing a bot ready for sharing with other users in your team](publication-add-bot-to-microsoft-teams-teams.md#install-a-bot-as-an-app-in-microsoft-teams), you can also change the bot's icon, color, and short and long descriptions. You can also enter more [information about who built the bot](publication-terms-of-use-teams.md).
