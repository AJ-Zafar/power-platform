# Ask questions using the AI cursor (preview)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

The AI cursor provides a way for you to interact with the data that’s generated. The AI cursor responds to natural language commands and provides contextual recommendations as you navigate the generated content.

When you use the AI cursor to ask a question about the content on a blueprint, you can choose to either generate as a new blueprint (by selecting generate as new blueprint) or as a new block (by selecting replace existing block) on the existing template.   

When content is generated, follow these steps to use the AI cursor:

1. Select the AI cursor or use the keyboard shortcut **Alt + C**.
2. Select the area or block of content and enter your question.
3. Press **Enter**. Or, select **Generate** > **Generate as new blueprint** or **Generate in place of existing block** to replace the data in the selected block.
