# Ask questions using the AI cursor (preview)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

The AI cursor provides a way for you to interact with the data that’s generated. The AI cursor responds to natural language commands and provides contextual recommendations as you navigate the generated content.
When content is generated, follow these steps to use the AI cursor:

1.	Select the AI cursor or use the keyboard shortcut **Alt + C**.
2.	Select the area or block of content that you want to ask Project Sophia questions about.
3.	Enter your question in the **AI cursor** text box.
4.	Select **Generate** or press **Enter**.
