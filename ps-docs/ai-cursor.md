# Ask questions using the AI cursor (preview)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

The AI cursor provides a way for you to interact with the data that’s generated. It responds to natural language commands and provides contextual recommendations as you navigate the content. Use the AI cursor to ask questions about the content on a blueprint or a block of content in the blueprint.

When content is generated, follow these steps to use the AI cursor:

1. Select the AI cursor or use the keyboard shortcut **Alt + C**.
2. Select an area or block of content to ask a question about and enter your question.
3. Press **Enter**. Or, select **Generate** > **Generate as new blueprint** or **Generate in place of existing block** to regenerate content in the selected block.
