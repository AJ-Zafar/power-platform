# Explore a topic (preview)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

When you ask a question or upload data and inquire about the data, a workspace is generated. The workspace is initially titled **Untitled**, but you can rename the default title. Your workspaces are all stored on the Home screen.

## Ask a question

1. Go to [https://projectsophia.preview.microsoft.com](https://projectsophia.preview.microsoft.com).
2. From the Home screen select **New workspace**.
3. Enter your question in the text box and then select **Generate**.


## Ask a question about your data

You can upload a data file and ask questions about the data. The supported file formats are .csv, .xlsx, and .pdf. For preview, the **connect to data** option isn’t available.

1. Use one of the following methods to ask questions about your data:
   - From the Home screen, on the **Onboarding** section, select **Go** > **Exploratory** > **upload data or use sample data**. You can also use the sample sales data provided to familiarize yourself with Project "Sophia".
   - Select **New workspace** > **Upload or connect to data** > **Upload a file**.
2. Select the file name and then select **Open**.
3. Select **Generate** or enter your question in the text box and then select **Generate**.
