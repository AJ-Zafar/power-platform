# Work with generated content (preview)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]


A blueprint is what you see after creating a new workspace, ask a question or upload data and then select **Generate**. You can also generate a new blueprint by selecting a suggested next step.  
When you use the AI cursor to ask a question about the content on a blueprint, you can choose to either generate as a new blueprint by selecting generate as new blueprint or as a new block by selecting replace existing block on the existing template.   

The following outlines the action you can take:

5. **Workspace name**: To rename a workspace select the default name **Untilted** and rename it. 
6. **Keep it**: Saves the generated content. Select the **Untitled** text box and enter a name for the generated workspace. If you don’t save the generated information, the system will automatically save it as **Untitled**. You can access all generated content from the Home screen.
7. **Regenerate**: Regenerates the results or select **Regenerate with new data** to replace with another data set instead of starting over. The **Regenerate** option can generate different results, but the level of difference depends on the specificity of the question asked. For instance, a general question such as “tell me something interesting about my data”, will likely generate different results if you regenerate, whereas as question such as “show me my top ten accounts based on last years’ sales numbers” will generate similar results, if you regenerate. 
8. **Discard**: Deletes the generated data.
9. **Show work and discard**: When content is generated, each block of content has a more menu (…) located at the upper-right corner. The menu has options to view more information about the generated content or discard it. 
**Show work**rovides clarity on how the content was generated and which skills were used to produce the content. **Discard** Removes the block of research. 
10. **Zoom and pan**: Use the pan and zoom to quickly navigate your content. The pan button provides an overview of your entire workspace, allowing you to navigate and zoom in and out on your blueprints.
