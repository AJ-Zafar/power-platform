# Work with generated content (preview)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

When content is generated, you can keep it, regenerate it, or delete it.

- **Keep it**: Saves the generated content. Select the **Untitled** text box and enter a name for the generated workspace. If you don’t save the generated information, the system will automatically save it as **Untitled**. You can access all generated content from the Home screen.
- **Regenerate**: Regenerates the results or select **Regenerate with new data** to replace with another data set instead of starting over. The **Regenerate** option can generate different results, but the level of difference depends on the specificity of the question asked. For instance, a general question such as “tell me something interesting about my data”, will likely generate different results if you regenerate, whereas as question such as “show me my top ten accounts based on last years’ sales numbers” will generate similar results, if you regenerate. 
- **Discard**: Deletes the generated data.


## Show work or discard it

When content is generated, each block of content has a more menu (…) located at the upper-right corner. The menu has options to view more information about the generated content or discard it. 

- **Show work**: Provides clarity on how the content was generated and which skills were used to produce the content. 
- **Discard** Removes the block of research. 

## Pan and zoom 

Use the pan and zoom to quickly navigate your content. The pan button provides an overview of your entire workspace, allowing you to navigate and zoom in and out on your blueprints.
