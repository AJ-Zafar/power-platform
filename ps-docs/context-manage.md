# Manage context

You can set a context for what data you want Project "Sophia" to consider.The Manage Context feature enables users to define and store custom contextual details that are automatically used to enhance response relevance and consistency from Project Sophia. This supports key contextual definitions such as fiscal year start, company specific acronyms, job role and industry details. 

Once set up, the contextual information will be embedded seamlessly into the prompt processing, reducing the need for repetitive input and ensuring that each response aligns with the user's intent. For example, specifying a fiscal year start date of April 1 enables project Sophia to interpret any mention of "Q1" or "this fiscal year" relative to the defined fiscal year start. For example, instead of having to ask,” How did we perform in April, May, June compared to July, August, September”, users can simply ask “How did we perform in Q1 vs. Q2”.  Acronyms can also be defined, eliminating ambiguity and enhancing clarity in outputs, particularly for company specific acronyms that are unlikely to be known by any AI model, or to provide context for column headers that aren’t necessarily descriptive for what type of data the column might hold. 

By streamlining this setup, Manage Context saves time and improves response accuracy, making it an invaluable feature for users who wants better alignment with the internal workings of their business.
